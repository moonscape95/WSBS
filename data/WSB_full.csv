1,Come on TSLA. Fly you regarded bird!!
2,"How is the volume so high, they are definitely naked short selling, what was the outcome of the GME squeeze"
1,"My bets would be on TSLA, and then possibly Apple. If you look at Apples earnings they have been shrinking since inflation started, and last quarter were basically right at EPS. When they post Q3 profits Im going to venture they miss EPS for the first time in a while and that will be the catalyst for the stock to tank. TSLA is almost a gimme at this point. To clarify this is companies that stock is going to plummet, not companies going bankrupt."
1,"I always feel like the media suggests stocks that can give you a 4% dividend, but missing the real divided stocks. Until recently I was under the impression that 4-5% was great. Why don't we see news articles on the stocks that pay 20-30% + ? SBLK - 33% EGLE - 18% GOGL - 26%"
1,"Unless I am missing something here, looks like Giga Cloud Technology should have been the rally instead of BBBY. Not sure if its too late but in 2 days it shot up from less than $5 to $50 a share. WTF WSB! Regards fo sho. You all need to do better about picking your yolos and all ins. Geebus, I am so sad now that even though I got out of BBBY at the right time, I was too distracted and missed GTC. Apes my ass! You know nothing apparently! Now question is do you still yolo gtc or fomo gtc?"
2,"Yeah, all those 2% losses offset my 5% losses. Now Im only 3.5% on the day and 30% on the year."
0,"As all of you who have long traded TSLA know, TSLA stock price follows laws of numerology. In particular, it has strong affinity for price points like ""$69"", ""$1337"", ""420"" and let us not forget, ""$420.69"", which is the most powerful of these. Because the board is going to do a 3:1 split, and because we know the shareholders will almost certainly support it, we can trade options in anticipation. Quite simply, a future share at $420.69 is thus $1262.07 in current value. The split sounds like it should be done by fall. So, the play is therefore to simply buy up November or October calls at $1262, or you could buy a bit lower to make sure it's ITM, call it $1200. I made jokes about this last time, and everyone thought I was being a moron, but had I actually done the trade I would've made 100x because the stock did in fact rally tremendously LAST time this happened, and crossed 420. Because past results are often a prediction of future performance\*, we can expect TSLA stock to end up north of $420.69, since that is the nature of things. Good luck losing money on this truly moronic idea based in no valid reasoning. \*many exceptions always apply"

2,"I had nothing left in Robinhood. I just had the last $5000 in my bank. I put it all in a binary options trading platform, and my play was- between 2 pm and 3 pm, if the stock moves either 1% up or down, I would double my money. It was so clear- if rate hike was 75 bps it would surely go up 1% and if 100 bps it would go down 1%. And I was right until 2.15 when the market crashed but I had to wait till 3 to make returns. I stopped looking for a while and voila! It swung up back to where it started, and I lost all my money. And then after 3 pm it did crash again, but my positions already expired. It's like the market went up temporarily just to burn my cash and then went back to where it should go. This has happened so many times, I am right with my plays but the stocks find that most unobvious small gap where I get fucked."

0,"So everyone is speculating about the EOM announcement of BBBY and at this point any positive announcement could ignite the fire and we could easily see $30+ prices. Some people say that the announcement will be bankruptcy. I kind of doubt it. Do companies make a planned public announcement where they announce bankruptcy? Don't they just silently file for bankruptcy and let people know it from the news? Also, there is the recent 8k filing... I see 3 possible outcomes: 1 - They announce bankruptcy. In this case I announce bankruptcy as well after ordering a rope from Amazon. 2 - They announce some neutral bullshit blahblah. This means that they are not going bankrupt right now, but somewhere in the near future, so we are fucked. 3 - They announce spinoff of Buybuy Baby. This means rockets and watermelon fucking.

2,I believe this quarter will be a huge revenue miss for $nvda due to softening pc demand and a crashing GPU demand (merge and dumping of gpu mining equipment on the market). Nvda is also currently trading at much higher multiples respect to AMD even though are projected to have a similar growth in the years ahead. It's either amd undervalued or it's nvidia overvalued? Given the current market sentiment i think it's the latter. If the market rebounds from this current low i intend to buy some november put at $100Change my mind.

However, I'd like to try being a more active investor, trading more specific index funds based on the most recent news and industry trends. Right now, for example, energy stocks are booming, so I would have loved to have bought VENAX 1-2 years ago. What tips and resources would you recommend to get started? Maybe some good books, etc.? I'm just trying to learn right now rather than jumping in and gambling money away."

It must be said that I initially just wanted to pocket. Yea sure, fuck the system and all and I liked what this stood for, but I honestly wanted to get in, grab some for myself, and get out. Well. Now I can't sell. I can't bring myself to do it. And it doesn't hurt, YET.I see now that it will only hurt if we lose. I don't want to lose to the HF, not my money. If we win, I don't care about the money. A lot of us put up a cost to fight. I'm paying mine. But if it's all for nothing and we all crumble and sell, that's where the real loss lies now. It isn't 2008, it's 2021. They've only gotten richer since. They have all the tools at their disposal to fuck us, more than they did in 2008, and they're fucking with us I don't want to lose. I don't think how they're causing us to lose is legal, so that pisses me off. Let's fucking win.

1,"S&amp;P500 futures are currently signalling further gains today, with USD continuing to pullback despite yesterdays comments from Chair Powell reiterating his plans to continue raising interest rates aggressively until inflation is under control. Interest rate markets have almost fully priced-in another 75bps rate hike for this months FOMC. However, maybe traders feel like the hawkish rhetoric that followed Jackson Hole has now been accounted for, and are once again looking ahead at the possibility of the Fed pivoting a slower pace of rate hikes after the September meeting? The S&amp;P500s rejection from resistance around 4300 seems to have found some support near 3900 this week. This constant back-and-forth of the Fed insisting on their priority being to curb inflation, and market expectations for the tightening cycle to ease, could cause $SPX to oscillate between these two key levels until the outlook becomes less murky. All trading carries risk, and next weeks CPI numbers will surely have a big role to play, but it will be interesting to see how this develops in the stock market."

These particular contracts are trading at .53 so if you own 10,000 shares you could sell 100 contracts for $5,300 credit. $BBBY closes below $20 on 9/3, you keep the premium and your shares. $BBBY closes above $20 on 9/3, you sell your shares at $20.

Some companies are great but the stock sucks. And vice versa. But SABR is still well below its pre pandemic trade range. It obviously tends to trade with the reopen trade. The GDS network hosts content from all airlines AND the biz model is driven by transaction volume, not pricing. Which of course leads to less cyclical volatility factors. At $15, its below its 52 week high. Still up 25% in the last 3 months. It definitely goes higher from here."

2,"I'm not going to pretend to know economics, but I do know the Fed has a tendency to over react. They should have left well enough alone during the pandemic. You can't use fiscal policy to combat a unique situation that wasn't exactly economic in nature. There were stimulus payments and inflated unemployment payments to get us through. Slashing the target rate to 0 was short sighted. Now they are going to overdo it again, and by the end of the year we will be sitting at 5%! Why they didn't have the foresight to see this coming last year is beyond me. I did. Historically, it would seem to me at least, 2.25-2.50 strikes a pretty good balance between interest rates, unemployment, and inflation. Sometimes you just have to give it enough time to work!"

2,"Nvidia reported second quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings per share. The report is in line with Nvidias preliminary earnings two weeks ago. The chipmaker warned that it would miss Wall Street estimates and that growth had slowed significantly because of disappointing gaming sales driven by macroeconomic conditions. It also warned its gross margin would drop. Nvidia missed on revenue but Refinitiv estimates didnt change after the company warned on guidance and said it expected to report $6.7 billion in the quarter. Nvidia stock fell over 4% in extended trading. Heres how Nvidia did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: **EPS: $0.51, adjusted, versus $1.26 expected** **Revenue: $6.7 billion versus $8.10 billion expected** The chipmaker said it expected $5.9 billion in sales in its fiscal third quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates of $6.95 billion. Nvidias gaming department revenue was down 33% year-over-year to $2.04 billion, which was a sharper decline than the company anticipated. Nvidia said that the miss was because of lower sales of its gaming products, which are primarily graphics cards for PCs. Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand for the companys gaming products, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on a call with analysts.

2,"TLDR; SEAS is not a 50$ stock. Im buying puts and thinking about going short for the first time ever. SeaWorld, ticker $SEAS, is an aquatic theme park that- look, Im sure you know what the fuck sea world is and the shady shit they do. To sum it up real quick, a documentary was released years ago called Blackfish exposing the abuse and mistreatment of the whales and animals in parks like these. Caused some controversy, but ultimately the company bounces back and people sort of forgot about it (not fucking me). Fast forward to 2020. Seaworld stock was now sitting at ATH of around $35 a share and COVID suddenly hits. A legendary WSB user known as u/fuzzyblanket notices and decides to buy $SEAS death puts right before it tanked due to covid. Long story short he got rich as fuck and has moved on from us retards now. Fast forward AGAIN to 2021. SEAS was sitting at around 30$ and in hopes of a quick recovery from this covid shit (vaccine hopes + short squeeze), investors and mainly institutions drove the price up. And Im talking wayyy up. From 30$ a share on February 1st, to all time highs of $50 by the end of March. Keep in mind that SeaWorld has been forced to keep some areas/events closed, and therefore revenue and attendance are down 96% yoy. They have had to add on a significant amount of debt to stay afloat as well, about $225 million, bringing total debt to around 2.2 billion now. Though I believe people may rush into these places after COVID, the damage from losing money for several quarters has been done, and whoever thinks this stock is worth 50$ when everything is not fully open is dreaming. A 70% gain in 2 months is simply unreasonable for a company losing 25 million every month. Our boy Fuzzy bought puts when SEAS was 35, I say buy em when its 50 now. Volume is low but has been increasing very quickly, the stocks up 4% today somehow. I genuinely think this is a shitty company, both financially and ESPECIALLY morally. I say FREE THE FUCKING WHALE and lets put this stock into the ground ."

Fwiw, I am not a bag holder. I was buying in the single digits thanks to r/shortsqueeze, and sold mostly in the 20s, but we could have been so much more Are we at rock bottom here?

However, that bullish sentiment may be short-lived. Its a good idea to be ready for anything as the final hours of Q3 2022 tick off the clock. On compressed time frames, shorts from just beneath $84.00 at isnt a bad way to play the action.

2,"Nouriel Roubini, an economist who predicted the 2008 financial crash, said he believes there is a ""long and ugly"" recession occurring in both the US and globally at the end of 2022, which could potentially continue through the whole of 2023. In an interview reported by Bloomberg, Roubini said it could cause a sharp correction in the S&amp;P 500 by 30%, ""even in a plain vanilla recession."" However, in his expectation of a ""real hard landing,"" the S&amp;P 500 could decline 40%. The chairman and chief executive officer of Roubini Macro Associates, nicknamed Dr. Doom following his 2008 prediction, warned that anyone expecting a shallow US recession should examine the extensive debt ratios of corporations and governments. Roubini added that as rates increase and debt servicing costs grow, ""many zombie institutions, zombie households, corporates, banks, shadow banks and zombie countries are going to die."" Meanwhile, he believes getting to a 2% inflation rate will be a ""mission impossible"" for the Federal Reserve, and he expects a 75bps rate hike at the current meeting and a 50bps increase in November and December. Roubini believes inflation means the Fed probably has no choice but to continue increasing rates, and when the world is in recession, he does not believe fiscal stimulus will be able to help as governments with too much debt are ""running out of fiscal bullets,"" resulting in stagflation. ""It's not going to be a short and shallow recession, it's going to be severe, long and ugly,"" Bloomberg quoted Roubini as saying. Source: [https://in.investing.com/news/nouriel-roubini-dr-doom-expects-a-severe-long-and-ugly-recession--bloomberg-432SI-3350293](https://in.investing.com/news/nouriel-roubini-dr-doom-expects-a-severe-long-and-ugly-recession--bloomberg-432SI-3350293) 'Dr Doom Nouriel Roubini expects stocks to fall as much as 40% amid a ""long and ugly"" global recession.

2,"Over the past 24 hours, GameStop NFT has made about $166,800 in sales. Since the platform only takes a 2.25 percent cut of NFT sales, this comes out to just $3,753 in revenue. Since GameStops nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace opened in mid-July, daily sales have dropped to less than $4,000. This suggests that interest in the platform has dropped significantly. Data from DappRadar shows that GameStop NFT has made about $166,800 worth of sales in the last 24 hours. Since the platform only takes 2.25% of NFT sales as a fee, the amount equals just $3,753 in sales during that time.

2,"lurker here. popped in here to see if anyone had been posting about the cel token short squeeze i had seen on twitter via #celshortsqueeze and read that wsb was involved. after some searches, not so much. at least not here on reddit. it seems i like investing in projects that get attacked, xrp, lbry, cel, and i keep a good chunk of my stuff in celsius network.i got contacted a couple times on twitter by fudsters trying to scare me out of celsius network. bunch of lies where told, but a couple truths i didn't know about (celsius had been trading assets but saying the yield was from loans)apparently a bunch of exchanges had told celsius network to go down with the ust/luna ship and celsius got out instead to protect it's customers, and now these exchanges are butt hurt and trying to destroy celsius in 3 different ways all while scapegoating celsius as the main reason ust/luna fell when it was already falling when celsius got out.first are intense fud campaigns which include a bunch of lies and a bunch of youtubers proclaiming celsius fully dead already when what they are having is a liquidity problem that forced them to halt withdrawals for the first time in their 4 years running. their assets in custody aren't lost, celsius hasn't lost funds, assets are loaned out, staked, and in general they shouldn't of staked so much e t h into e t h 2.0 so, they have access to the assets just not right away, no company with this type of earning model would because the assets are being put to work and can't handle a sudden bank run for assets.the second way celsius is being attacked is they have a long out that will get about half a billion of people's live savings liquidated if b t c dips below 14k. yesterday these exchanges where trying their best to dip the price so that would happen.the third is there are massive whale shorts on the cel token. trying to crush the cel token to help drive out people from celsius network. yesterday celsians and wsb telegram group decided to take as much cel off the exchanges so ftx can't cover the shorts that are happening. most celsians are hodlers and are just going to keep the cel token, where as the wsb telegram types are taking their cel to 1inch and putting in sell orders so ftx's only cel tokens it can buy are 20, 50, and 100 dollars each. earlier this week cel was .15 cents, it's currently .67 cents. i bought my cel early 2021 for 2.10, it went up to 8 mid 2021.celsius isn't perfect, they put their customers first over back room deals/friendships with other institutions, and probably didn't know just how much they would be between a rock and a hard place. that they would get bullied this hard by institutions that don't care if they destroy peoples lives and are in fact actively trying to hurt people. so.. while celsius fucked up... i rather see the types who are trying to destroy lives to really feel a short squeeze. not financial advice. you can read more about it on twitter via #celshortsqueeze , and aaron bennet on youtube put out the best info I've found about the matter so far. what i am posting here is just a summary, it goes much deeper."

A death spiral describes a type of convertible asset that forces the creation of an ever-increasing number of shares, inevitably leading to a steep drop in the prices of shares (aka dilution).

This process by definition increases the number of $AMC shares in the market, and that forces prices lower. The death spiral effect occurs as more and more $APE shares are converted to $AMC as their value drops lower and lower"

0,"War is driven by profit. This is magnified by long-time inclusion of war companies into the S&amp;P500 and other prominent stock indices like the DOW. Most people work hard and try to grow their wealth through investment. Historical results clearly show that investing into companies representing the S&amp;P500 is a good idea. Naturally, this translates into a situation where the people themselves are incentivized into growing the S&amp;P500 further. The US economy, as dire as it looks, is now at a point where market capitalizations of prominent corporations are now in the Trillions of dollars. Capitalism has made the USA so powerful that companies that are considered Small are worth Billions of dollars. This maturity of the US economy is so substantial that war companies cannot compete anymore with Technology and other businesses that are thriving. There are not enough bombs and places to bomb that can ever sustain profitability for these companies without hijacking the citizens' tax dollars through US ""defense"" spending and other leechlike tactics. Our society is at a point in time where we do not have a real need for war companies any longer. However, there are misaligned incentives that are still in place. As long as these companies represent a significant portion of the S&amp;P500 and other indices there will always be a stirring hunger towards unnecessary conflicts in the world. It's time to cut off the head of the snake and de-list them from the S&amp;P500. This will start a massive push towards their irrelevancy and they will no longer be supported by the money machine."

1,"It's the day after FOMC and markets are selling off. $MSFT, however, briefly dipped below its June lows and has since recovered, making it one of the few large-cap stocks in the green today. That being said, this dip below support could be a deviation before pushing higher or the beginning of much more downside ahead. Regardless, something of interest to note right now is that the number of MSFT social mentions, as tracked by LunarCrush, is showing sustained growth with more and more people creating posts and talking about Microsoft Corp (MSFT) right now at these price levels. [$MSFT Price &amp; Social Mentions \(1-Year Activity\)](https://preview.redd.it/xk8m052t3gp91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=949dd21edb92d4706dd3e50572a672d6e82cea1c) I find this interesting because, for the first time since $MSFT's ATH back in Nov 2021, the social activity around $MSFT is trending up again, after months of trending down. So according to this data, there is a peak of interest in MSFT right now and it continues to grow. Whether this peak of interest in MSFT is short-sighted or long-sighted is up to interpretation but is interesting nonetheless. What do you guys think about this? Is $MSFT's rising social activity a bullish sign? Are people fearful right now? Are they wanting to buy? Let's discuss!"

0,"The penny is basically worthless. That's what hedgies want you to think. Sure, we can round everything to the nearest 0.05. Sure, Big Zinc has lost significant power. Sure, the penny costs too much to produce. That's the narrative. Quietly, behind the scenes, capital management funds are increasing their penny reserves. Why? Because the penny offers legitimate long term value. In an inflation ridden world, the death of the penny is inevitable. Long term the penny represents true, inflation resistant value. That's because it will become scarce - only 21 trillion have ever been produced. And if the price drops the demand for the penny will surge. With the growing population, the world desperately needs the zinc for vitamins. Tldr - hide your kids, hide your wife, hide your pennies."

2,"Ford Motor on Monday warned investors that the company expects to incur an extra $1 billion in costs during the third quarter due to inflation and supply chain issues. Ford said supply problems have resulted in parts shortages affecting roughly 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles, primarily high-margin trucks and SUVs that havent been able to reach dealers. The company expects to complete and deliver the vehicles to dealers in the fourth quarter and is still projecting 2022 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.Shares of the company fell about 5% in extended trading following the update. Ford cited recent negotiations resulting in inflation-related supplier costs that will run about $1 billion higher than originally expected. The automaker anticipates third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. Ford added that executives will provide more dimension about expectations for full-year performance when it reports its third-quarter results on Oct. 26. Automakers have been battling supply chain problems since the coronavirus pandemic brought manufacturing to a standstill in early 2020. Demand continued to be strong despite ongoing issues with the availability of parts, specifically, semiconductor chips. Fords largest crosstown rival, General Motors, announced similar issues earlier this year. GM on July 1 warned investors that supply chain issues would dent its second-quarter earnings, noting it had about 95,000 vehicles in its inventory that were manufactured but lacked some components. GM at the time also reconfirmed its yearly guidance and said it expects that substantially all of these vehicles will be completed and sold to dealers before the end of 2022. https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/19/ford-warns-investors-of-1-billion-in-supply-chain-costs-during-the-third-quarter.html"

1,"BBBY just had a spike on its MACD from 0.48 to 1.61 a 3.3x increase. GME experienced a similar bump in Jan 2021. 0.98 to 5.45, a 5.5x increase. GME only had a 5.5x pop the week after its entire option chain went ITM. As of now, BBBY's entire option chain is over 80% ITM. If BBBY goes to 45 before Friday, it's safe to say this thing will blow to GME regard levels. I'm buying call options +50% above share price when the new chain is out. Currently hold 45$ AUG 19 call options. Holding until tomorrow because I expect massive AH/PM movement with this much volume. I do not think brokers are capable of settling this many trades which will lead to force settlements in the AH/PM before opening bell tomorrow. By law, you shares have to be settled before opening bell T+2. With the massive volumes we've been having, I highly doubt they've been able to keep up meaning they'll have to buy AH or PM before Thursday. If the volume keeps up the way it is, it's just going to keep chaining and chaining and this is gonna be stupid."

I was more cautious when BBBY came around and decided to hop in at $28, thinking it was a safe entry after all that volume and RC being on the board and having those $80 calls. What she fails to understand tho, is that between, mine, her, and her boyfriends salary, we make $500K per year so $150K is not bad. $4800 a month in payments to my broker? Thats nothing. I can easily make that back fairly quickly but she refuses to let me open an account under her name. Her boyfriend doesnt care either way, he said he would help fund it, but she refuses. Now Im just a meme or some kind of joke to millions of people around the world because she went and panicked and called some upstart little kids who wouldnt know the first thing about day-trading because all they do is invest in safeboomer funds hoping to get close to 3% a year.

Today we just closed our 6th red day in a row This is something that has not happened since the Feb 2020 covid crash which saw 7 red days in a row and dropped 15.7% over that time period. SPY currently has fallen 7.4% over 6 days now. Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I havent felt capitulation or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. CNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the worst week of the year for stocks with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with I wonder how this week is going to finish out. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/tkfhdtxyahq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22112a516715d92cf1c159a93a57b3a5e9bfbea5 Looking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. The one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didnt just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight. Support- 362.1 -&gt; 360.2 (red support) -&gt; 358.2 (blue support) -&gt; 355.4 -&gt; 352.3 Resistance- 364.3 -&gt; 365.6 (red resistance) -&gt; 368.2 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 373.7 (blue resistance and gap fill) &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/31g6d9hzahq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b228a328b8a341912e0b7d350cedd73b32f1b9 Taking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. Key support- 3635 -&gt; 3615 (blue support) -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3545 Key resistance- 3670 -&gt; 3706 (blue resistance) -&gt; 3770 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/mul8f900bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=381e87f542780f0db41d5345bedf97b0f419ed3c Looking at apple this morning once again which has been trend for the last week we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. I was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. The thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we havent hit capitulation and we havent been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. Key supports- 150.7 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.1 Key resistance- 152.4 -&gt; 154.5 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/rabr1ak0bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421f0e076579dbbf7cccfc8a56f8f154fa23a45e Tesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. Tesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. Support- 270.3 -&gt; 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) Resistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 292 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/5gasyw21bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6448fd81850b4f6eed3e8b5f0f007ea3619718d7 Just when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50 I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in. I am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I havent really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. The next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. 10% challenge- &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/bqhagwr1bhq91.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccfb99337d2ece731e9d1ada0d441082a2798fec You know honestly not my best day today I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. From there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. This is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being smarter than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. I am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really dont know where to go from here but thats why when in doubt we dont swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. Overall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight.

0,"hey! As per my knowledge ,StockGro has launched its application on play store and app store. There are talks about the web version getting launched soon in few days so we can keep a check on the same . As excited as I am to try out the web version I have a feeling that I personally would prefer the interface of their app. The leagues and social groups for me are the winning features that make it one of the best social platforms for learning about the stock market at zero capital risk. My favourite would also definitely include the Model portfolios feature which unables beginners to learn and also introduces a great way for the investors to test their strategies without risking their capital in the markets. Talking about their presence on the web they have a website on which everything about the company is provided. Being a virtual trading platform, maximum demand is for a mobile application. The downloads on play store for the app are ten million plus. Now that app store also has thousands of downloads making it one of the top apps in the virtual trading field. For every trader, a mobile app would be more useful.Having a good and easy user interface makes it easy for everyone as there is No lag in between trades and using any part of the application. I would definitely suggest you using the mobile application once as the experience is something not to miss."

0,I was thinking about the best way to undo the damage of money prints and personally I think the best idea is just to take you money out as cash. Fractional reserve means that for every $10 you remove the bank looses $100 of lending power so it hurts them more than us. If every American removes $1000 on average that will basically Thanos snap 2.8 Trillion dollars out of the banking industry even though we would only remove about 300 billion. Any thoughts on this idea?

2,"AMC Entertainment stock was sinking fast on Monday and had dropped more than 11% in trading after the theater chain announced a new distribution agreement to sell up to $1.4 billion worth of APE shares. The so-called APE shares, or AMC Preferred Equity Units, have the same economic value and voting rights as a share of common stock. The idea was for AMC to use the proceeds from the sale of the new stock to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase existing debt, as it said in Mondays filing. The APEs are even named after the meme traders that helped to boost the companys stock price last year. The market however soured at that idea, and while the APEs are up on the day, theyve dropped 41% in value in the past month since the new stocks were first announced by Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron on August 22 at a price of $6, now sitting at $3.78. Meanwhile, AMCs stock itself over that same period has also dropped 21.1%. While it was disclosed that up to 425 million shares of APEs would be sold, the announcement is a placeholder and does not specifically indicate how many will ultimately be sold or by when. Aron has previously argued that since the shares are going to already existing shareholders rather than going directly on sale, APEs would not dilute AMCs stock value. With the creation of APEs, AMC is deeply and fundamentally strengthening our company. Given the flexibility that APEs will give us, we will likely be able to raise money if we need or so choose, which inmmensely lessens any survival risk as we continue to work our way through this pandemic to recovery and transformation, Aron said in the letter announcing their creation last month.

1,"As many of you know there has been a lot of speculation in the mainstream media lately that Bed, bath and beyond was heading into bankruptcy but their most recent press releases and SEC filings make it perfectly clear that this IS NOT the case. This is the most bullish and exciting time to be a BBBY investor knowing that an $800M market cap stock is heading for the big leagues!!! The BBbaby brand will lead the way in growth, happy early Christmas and remember to buy everyone you know a gift card from the greatest home wares store in the world"
0,"Hi guys, I will try to keep this short. This earnings is very important, as it will set analyst expectations for the next two years to come. MarketScreener released an article last Friday before market close describing this in great detail, but was likely pulled from the newsfeed. I cannot find it anymore :( Its likely pulled for a good reason, to discourage investors from profiting on the downside. Banks who have downgraded the price target for MU are expecting a soft guidance. &amp;#x200B; Micron Technologies after June 2022 earnings was able to shrink their NAND technology from 232 layers to 176 layers. Investors are expecting at least a 160 NAND layer chip to compete with Western Digital's 162 layer chip this earnings . [https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/micron-rolls-out-232-layer-nand-raising-storage-ambitions](https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/micron-rolls-out-232-layer-nand-raising-storage-ambitions) &amp;#x200B; With R&amp;D costs increasing and supply chain shortages, I believe Micron Technologies will likely experience a market overreaction come Friday after earnings release."

1,"I sold me GME option way to early. Made a few thousand bucks, missed out on a few hundred thousand more. I never even bought BBBY.

1,S&amp;P would probably be slightly safer. But this is again just a crap shoot. Either option in your scenario is likely to have similar results. If another large company in the S&amp;P drags it down like tesla for example and you get in then. You might get slightly better returns. Over that period of time I think both are nearly equal in risk/reward. Whatever you choose good luck hope your yelds are plentiful

1,"TLDR; If you don't believe in Technical analysis, you can ignore this post. However, I believe that in the absence of detrimental news (i.e. bankruptcy, insolvency, or some other failure) the Nasdaq may be in for a brief relief rally early next week around \~11,200 adjusted +/- 100 points on either side for margin of error. &amp;#x200B; [We are currently at 11,418 on the NQ1! futures chart.

This rally will also not indicate a bullish trend but may offer an opportunity for leveraged traders utilizing TQQQ or other leveraged funds to make short 1-3 day profits. I'm very bearish on the market overall, but I look for opportunities wherever they can be found."

Meanwhile, all the other markets continue and we can miss some potential opportunities. **Don't neglect crude oil this week. It's dropping exactly as forecast but from the Daily we are now just a whisker away from the 75 support area from 2021.** With the Russia price cap still to be defined a potential reversal in crude is a very real prospect.

2,"The DXY is at 20 year highs while inflation is at 40yr highs and interest rates are at 10+ yr highs. The fed stopped 14 years of printing. Half the small businesses in the world are still recovering from the pandemic. There's a war that's realigned directly and indirectly most of the world's energy supply chains and fucked assume of the poorest nations on earth's food supply chains. Energy and food are near if not at at all time highs - globally. Even in net exporting Australia our electricity is flying, blackouts are threatened, and lettuce is like $10 a head. The banks, globally didn't learn a thing they weren't forced to. Basel 17 our whatever they're up to now looks like it might get tested soon. The Fed, ECB, JCB can't bail them out right now if they fuck up - and I doubt the long feared ""derivatives time bomb"" ever got papered over enough to defuse it. Housing is another global time bomb - high historical prices and high current interest rates mix like butter and glue. I could keep going. Point is, at some point, and it may have already happened (Evergrande?) something has to give. Somewhere, someone, a company or nation, will default Lehman style, and it won't be contained - and more importantly, no central bank or government will be able to rescue it. I won't pretend to know how it will happen this time but most of the time it's counterparty risk that does it. One default cascades to the people they borrowed from, then they default, then it snowballs, then credit seizes up as no one trusts any borrower to repay, forcing central banks to intervene - but can they this time? Pouring bailouts on top of generational inflation highs seems unlikely. Given their generally delusional forecasts and commentary (""transitory"" anyone?) it seems most likely they won't act early. Most likely outlying probably be too late. Governments, generally speaking are already in huge debts, and the central banks will be reluctant to backstop bailouts - especially in poorer countries with already high USD denominated debt. Again, DXY at 20yr highs means they're already struggling to make repayments. Something has to give. Call me a , but tell me, is my assessment overlooking some great optimistic hope?"

2,"SIX aka Six flags has been performing worse and worse over the years as the market for theme parks decline and consumers spend more on electronic entertainment. Currently SIX is deemed overvalued by more than $3 (according to yahoo finance), and has missed EPS the last quarter and only met EPS in the other two due to low predictions. Monetary policy has become so aggressive that consumers more than ever will hesitate to spend especially on something as outdated as theme parks + we are going into winter and the likely hood of another ""varient"" (even tho its probs just a flu variant) is likely to appear soon. No one goes to theme parks in the winter and there is only one in Georgia that can possibly attract customers on warmer winter days (but with climate/tempreture extremes I doubt more than ever that will happen). Six flags additionally pays for its properties with loans, these are property loans and are thus not fixed. Six flags is gonna be forced to pay for these properties with cashflow it doesn't have in an industry already dying. &amp;#x200B; Big investors already know this and the downward trend we saw this afternoon proves that this is an industry that is and will continue to be fucked hard by jpow trying to be a wannabe volckner. &amp;#x200B; Earnings come out OCT 25th but I predict SIX dumping sometime this early oct as prices drop and hedgies and bulge bracket banks begin to pump and dump to setup positions. &amp;#x200B; Maybe this is already happening... but def not the bottom"
2,"Just recently picked up some calls. I was wondering what everyone was feeling for this stinky boii down in the gutter right now. Any potential upside, last I heard was the recall was only for a software update so why is it down so bad?"
0,Seriously want to know the subs thoughts on SPCE. They have a lot of plans for space travel from training camp resorts to multiple launches back to back and ships under construction that can handle higher capacity of customers. Legit asking if this community sees them as having a chance in the space race. This will probably be seen by few but I'll take whatever at this point. 3 day weekend BBBY break on the sub so maybe people will read. Can someone translate this to memes for the non readers?
0,"In short, I want to invest in index and reinvest dividend to use compounding. My issue is I see video on people saying to invest in SPY, but that one has been crashing so it makes no sense to me. I dont want to invest in something already crashing. What indexes are a good choice that allow for dividends and reinvesting gains? Any advice helps!"
0,"Really? I live in England and some of the most lucrative companies are gambling ones (that specialise in online sports betting). I really think the online sports betting industry in the US will explode soon with the likes of FanDuel and DKNG advertising so heavily in US sports the past year. They will be creating so many addicts and will only create more as sports betting becomes a more common hobby (which it will). The sports betting companies are actually trying to move away from horse racing as gamblers can gain an edge, something that's harder to do in major sports like NFL or Soccer. Also, the major sports have a bigger following thus giving them a better opportunity to create gambling addicts out of fans of those sports. I have no inside knowledge or anything though, just my take on it from an outside perspective as someone who has seen how vast the sports betting industry has become in the UK. I was a gambling addict myself and know how vicious that addiction is."

Now I hear hot topic is getting into the nipple ring market. Never heard of the nipple ring market? Well everyone has two nipples right? That is 660 million nipple rings in the us alone. At 10 dollars a piece that is an untapped 6.6 billion dollar market. Its going to be on the cutting edge of online nipple ring technology. Your wife is going to need some new jewelry to impress her boyfriend right? And only 4 of them have shut down where I live. Unlike bbby which has closed every store in my area including the one right next to a college full of basic white girls.

0,"Yes, Robinhood sucks and should not be used for investments. I use it for one thing: gambling. I use other services for actual investments. With that being said, I am still somewhat shocked that this happened. I was randomly given stock rewards, about $10 worth of a stock that I chose. I didnt think anything of it as I previously received similar stock rewards with no issue. Then the next day, the stocks were no longer showing in my account. I received [this email](https://i.imgur.com/fTt4Ka6.jpg) saying that it was a technical issue and that it has been resolved by removing them. Customer support was useless and just reiterated the same information. I have never received awards and had them retracted before. This seems like a big mistake that they should not just be able to brush aside. What if I sold it off already?! Would they still legally be allowed to take back the funds? I guess if Im ever stupid enough to try to jump on a meme stock again, Ill go elsewhere. Even for a gambling app, Robinhood is bullshit."
2,"So I am convinced the stock is good as dead. My question is, do y'all think it could bounce any more or should I sell at ~$7.30 and take the loss. My avg is $11 a share. What are you doing?"

Im relatively new to investing, as I joined RH in late January. I heard theyre pretty bad about options , so Im on WB now. Should I sell my 100 shares and buy a call option or just keep the 100 and buy a call anyways? Im also in a financial accounting class right now, but it hasnt bro get much light to options. Any advice would be great."
1,BBBY is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. &amp; Now.. there is catylist to short it even more one would think. Shorts having to cover for possibly over 50% free float would be nuts if retail buys in this week.
1,After the reversed split thus stock is no longer in danger of being unlisted. They now own a liquor company providing extra cash flow. They have an investment division that takes advantage of banks unwillingness to provide capital to other grow industries Personally I'm enthusiastic about the potential in this company. I would like some criticism and general input.
1,Apes! We need your help! Morgan Stanley is trying to burn CCL. Where else are us apes supposed to party amongst international waters? Huge upside potential and the opportunity to take down one of the major corrupt market movers.
1,"First off, there is only one squeeze to squoze right now: #GME, and it has not been squozed! To maintain focus of this discussion is that now that we have established there should only be one squeeze at a time, it's hard to say when it will end. And once it is over there will need to be some time for us to reload. #Normies sell, WSB holds! Therefore I purpose that we should focus our efforts and have one squeeze per X, whether that be per quarter or per year I am not sure. but there should probably be at least a month between squeezes. What do you think?"

0,Today robinhood took the liberty of selling my contacts for me due to high volatility. It also happened to expire today but I was still squeezing!!
0,"I'm trying to make the question as simple as possible. Given everything we know about float, who owns what, potential short interest. Say 20% of people sell out at $10k, would that fuck it for the rest of us, or at that point, assuming it jumped there quickly, would the stock, theoretically, continue climbing if the rest held?"
2,"VIX dropping, lads bake some more expiry time into any puts you are buying"
0,"I put on a trade on SPY, a long call, 10 minutes before the gap down. I had a take-profit and a stop-loss. Because of this I went and did something else and I get a notification that an order filled. I jump back on to see the gap down and thought to myself of course BUT the take-profit was the filled order. The call was just OTM so I doubt it had enough delta to move up enough to trigger the take-profit. So was it the jump in volatility that spiked the price of the option (and saved my bacon)?"
0,"VC, real estate (a bit more complex), high debt companies, and smaller companies will be drowned out the next few years as they struggled to compete with 10-15% APR loans. On the other hand, large tech giants with little or no debt will thrive as they will be competing in a landscape with anemic startup competition. Think Microsoft and Amazon no longer competing with smaller Cloud platforms as Cloud is capital intensive at the start. Real estate is complex because real estate relies on cost-of-carry, and despite common consensus, most rentals are owned by individuals or small groups (families, a few partners teaming up). If the cost-of-carry goes up and stays high for a few years, then we expect these individuals will be less likely to hold onto their older properties when purchasing a new one. Thus, supply will increase and prices should drop. Earnings for large companies may contract, or earnings growth may slow, but this does not matter so long as rates are eventually reduced back to what the Fed believes is neutral. In this case, that is around 2.5%."

ARLP is currently $17.89 a share, and you can buy $15 2024 calls for $4.50 per at the mid. Gives you a breakeven of 19.50, or 9% above the current price. Not only are you buying ITM, you also get a year and a half of runway. Alliance Resource Partners is primarily a coal company, with some oil/gas ties. I personally am extremely bullish on coal in particular, so I plan on buying a decent amount of LEAPs very soon."
0,"I'm loaded up to the tits on 365$ spy puts that expire this next week. I was waiting for JPOWs magnificent giant red dild to DESTROY futures last night, so I held into closing yesterday.

So far this has only happened twice, because i started trading again last week. The first time was not that bad, it hurt; but the second time i actually really liked it but pretended not to. I knew i shouldnt have held my puts last night, but i couldnt stop thinking about my 7/10 wife ramming me till whatever shes using hangs out like chipped ham. Anyway, to add to my experience, i want to involve the community with my method of saving a marriage even if your direct deposit goes straight to your broker. So if my spy puts close red today, i will let the top vote decide what my wife tops me with. Good luck today guys"

Wouldnt you want to buy t lowest strike calls as those would be more valuable due to the option to exercise at that lower strike? Am I just retarded? Thanks in advance!
1,"What do you look for when looking for the opportunity to jump in and buy call options for a massive gamma move in a heavily borrowed stock? Low float? $BIG has a much lower float than any of the favorites $AMC $GME $BBBY that have become legendary. Low daily trading volume? At an average volume of only 1.2 million shares traded, $BIG wins this one hands down. Big moves can be created here. Off the radar? No one is talking about Big Lots. Just like they never talked about $GME $AMC or $BBBY but $BIG is extremely high on the hedge fund hit list. (#6 as of Fridays close) Cheap out of the money call options? How about those $30 OCT 21 CALLS for 5/10 cents with almost 10,000 open interest? What would happen if this were to suddenly have 100,000 open interest? Best of all, how about a good underlying business? $BIG pays a fat 6.5% dividend with a positive PE ratio unlike any of the other WSB favorites. This company sells close out stuff at a heavy discount and does very well in a recession. So the opportunity to create some excitement is there. Its laid out on a silver platter in front of us. The question is, are we yesterdays news? Are we just focused on the past or are we capable of making some new excitement and some new Gamma? I like em $BIG."
1,"Guys, just take a minute and zoom out your vision from stocks like $GME and $AMC and realize that $GOOG $GOOGL is at an extremely rare valuation right now. Even if it drops more from here you are getting a great price for it, I wouldn't pass this up... Google is now trading for a 16x forward earnings and 11x EBITDA. Its not as sensitive to supply chain issues and inflation as other companies are. Google is literally the internet and not going anywhere and is a huge monopoly with no competitors even dreaming of coming close. It is also extremely oversold with an RSI below 30 and at 52 week lows. This is one of those All-In opportunities that you can feel proud of and brag to your dads boyfriend about. Again... We are talking about freaking Google here, everyone uses Google and Google uses everyone. I have been loading shares under $100. Anyways this is my opinion and not my financial advise yada yada"

1,"Due to the huge market stock and consumers' pursuit of cost performance, the secondary economy has gradually emerged. According to the 2021 Carbon Emission Reduction Report of China's Idle Second hand Trading released by Sullivan in conjunction with several research institutions, domestic second-hand idle goods trading has become a large market with a scale of more than one trillion. In 2020, the trading scale of second-hand idle goods in China will be 1254 billion yuan, which is expected to be close to 3 trillion yuan by 2025. By the first half of 2022, RERE has opened a total of 1446 offline stores in 214 cities across the country. At the same time, RERE also provides door-to-door, mailing, self-service recycling machines and other recycling modes. In addition, it is worth noting that RERE has also undertaken the old phone recycling service of mobile phone manufacturers and e-commerce platforms online, and further improved the front-end recycling scenario through the ""old for new"" and other services launched by JD and mobile phone manufacturers. In terms of mid tier processing, RERE has established a standardized quality inspection system with 38 quality inspection standards and 42 quality inspection levels, and has opened the automated quality inspection capability to industry merchants. Through this way of empowering businesses, the B2B trading platform ""Paijitang"" under RERE has attracted more than 300000 businesses. In terms of back-end sales, RERE is also constantly improving the service level of the platform. For example, ""Paipai Strict Selection"" has launched seven days' return without reason, one-year warranty and other after-sales services to eliminate consumers' worries about buying second-hand products."

I can answer the ""why"" on a separate thread, but there's a lot of research and study I have put in over the last few months and have been tracking the economy for years. What I want to understand is, which ETF should I use since I want to take a 9-12 month long position. Many of these ETFs are daily rebalancing etc. which is basically for day traders, which is not useful for my purpose. Some ETFs I could find were IYF, FAZ, SEF, SKF. But again since I have not taken such positons on a sector before using ETFs I am not sure at all. Any ideas, thoughts, suggestions?"

1,"There is an ongoing fight for Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) between $ULCC and $JETS. My question is, why is nobody talking about this or buying it? Apparently, at the start $ULCC and $SAVE were supposed to merge where $ULCC would acquire $SAVE and deal would be for approximately $25.84. Then $JETS saw that and offered cash to buy $SAVE and they keep throwing more and more cash on this deal, I think up to $33 per share. Now, currently $SAVE is trading around $22, so if any of these deals goes through = free money. If not, then you are still buying an airline stock for fairly cheap in an environment where air travel is increasing. And for those who like to YOLO, there is some sort of $SAVE shareholder meeting tonight where they would decide (hopefully) what is the future of the company and what deal they want to go with."

The entire point of the sub is in the damn title. Wallstreetbets. It's that last word right there that's important. Thats what this sub is supposed to be about: GAMBLING.

To those who are salty about all the BBBY posts and theories; I don't blame you. I'll admit I've only been here since Jan '21 and the Apestock fiasco is what brought me here. HOWEVER, it's not why I stayed. I'm here because of what WSB was. People making outrageous bets and either losing it or making fucking bank. In fact I wish I had discovered this sub long before Apestock if for no other reason then it probably wasn't filled with so many whiny babies talking bout how they ""feel tricked"" or that ""sHoRtS hAvEnT cLoSeD"" or any other conspiracy. You made the choice to put your money into the market so its your problem if you lost money. Stop blaming others. This is not a sub for financial advice, if you want that go to r/stocks. As far as my position goes? I see 3 potential outcomes; 1. BBBY dies and my money goes bye bye. 2. BBBY doesn't die and somehow turns itself around and I make my money back. 3. I double down and buy 70 more shares and sell CCs against it until one of the two above options occurs.

Nasdaq dropped 80% and took 15 years to recover! **At the end of July 2008** , Cramer called the bottom.Specifically, he said the bear market was over and it was time to back up the truck.

Jan 2025 Calls are available to buy LEAPS for those looking for a long term option trade. I bought leaps &amp; own the stock. $BIG offers a 6.5% dividend yield and has a PE ratio of 7. The underlying business is solid. They had a few missteps with excess inventory last quarter and fired their merchandising manager as a result. This cause a lot of write downs and a loss on the quarter. This was latched onto by the institutional shorts and here we are - a good company being shorted into the ground. Buy the calls! Buy the stock!

0,"I have a question If at the start of the day I look at SPY and buy 5 options for out of the moneybouts expiring today priced at approx $0.50 each and then try to sell them with limit orders at $0.6, $0.70, $0.80,$0.90 and $1.0. Would that be profitable overtime doing that daily? If they go above $1 then I'm done and I made $150, but if they expire as worthless I lose $500, but don't sub $1 options bounce around a lot? Couldnt I tried trade them and make a profit before they all expire at the end of the day?"

1,AKRO is so Fing shorted that my trading app (trading 212) doesn't even let me short it.If we all bought and HODL this stuff it could be the next meme stock.

1,I might buy here if Im being honest. VIX over 9% means we should get a bounce within the next two days. Lets close at a new low and then all aboard.

If you tards are like me (most of you aren't, I'm a god damn genius with a huge cock) you occasionally step outside our community of degenerates to see what others are saying ( r/stocks, r/investing, r/options, all that pussy shit). And lately they all have the same posts ""Hey guys, I'm down 40%/50%/60% and I'm still trying to DCA but things are getting tough, bills/gas/mortgage (poor peoples problems)"". So I'm wondering do you really think the big money (hedges, institutional) is going to buy back in while retail is still buying.

They are now on panic mode stage, I would not be surprised if theyre holding meetings with NASDAQ, regulators, and big banks to see what can be done to stop the madness because theres no way they can fulfill these obligations.

1,"As the world looks for new ways to implement clean energy into our everyday lives, switching from gas-powered vehicles to electric is at the top of the list. Major motor vehicle manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford, BMW, Kia, and many others have poured millions of dollars into marketing trying to get a headstart in dominating the global EV market. According to the BBC, in the next three years, 20% of all new cars sold will be electric vehicles, 40% by 2030, and nearly 100% by 2040. Allied Market Research reports that the global EV market was valued at $163.01 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $823.75 billion by the end of the decade, thus giving the industry a compound annual growth rate of 18.2% from 2021-2030. So yeah, the EV market is fully charged right now (pun very much intended). Due to the market's expected growth, picking the right company to invest in has the potential for massive returns. We believe these promising EV stocks will perform the best on the market. Continue reading: [Best 5 EV Stocks to Watch](https://www.jika.io/blog/Best%205%20EV%20Stocks%20to%20Watch)"

However, there is something of interest going on with $INTC at these incredibly low prices. Despite a bearish stock price, the social activity surrounding $INTC is increasing with sustained growth in the number of social mentions (unique mentions of $INTC), and the number of social contributors (unique people talking about $INTC). Social mentions: 72.9K +50.19%Social contributors: 157 +45.37% **What does this mean? And how can we use this information to our advantage?** The recent rise in $INTC social activity indicates that theres increasing interest in $INTC at these levels. And since the stock price is already down so much, we must ask ourselves **Are the people contributing to this increased interest looking to short $INTC or long $INTC?** Im willing to bet it's the latter. I mean, the stock price is already incredibly low so it's logical to think that people are talking more frequently about $INTC now because they want to buy. Anyways, I think social activity around stocks can be very telling, and its fun to try and decipher what the market is thinking. So, what do you guys think? Is the increase in $INTC social activity bullish? Or bearish?"

If the age of their account is lower than the number that you just picked; they are a bot! This one can also be applied to karma. Other signs: lack of crayons, lack of imagery and videos with green arrows edited into them, lack of OG stocks like GME and AMC. Any use of Robinhood is 100% a bot.

Their liquid assets alone are almost equal to their stock price, they have little debt, they turned a profit for the first time this year, and the P/E is &lt;1 right now. The reason why dry bulking and ZIM are low is because of China's corona outbreak and the war in Ukraine, but those can't go on forever and the demand will inevitably rise. There's also a solid chance we see a short squeeze in ZIM because larger forms are shorting it in the next couple months. At an all time low price of $34.49 this weekend, its a must buy right?

Some of my famous past predictions have included my ""Boomers &amp; Brokers - Economic Theory of the CoronaVirus Market Decline"" and ""Trump Organized the 2020 Iran Strike to Boost Stocks"" so you know you're dealing with 100% legit and accurate predictions here. I now come to you with my latest theory: Onlyfans is the only meaningful indicator of market conditions and the fed will raise rates until people are forced to cut their onlyfans subscriptions, which will show as a meaningful decline in revenue from the service. Since I know you all love charts, I would like to start off by introducing you to some charts in order for me to come off as more legitimate.

(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE). Onlyfans is a limited subscription service offering a product that individuals are able to get FOR FREE (with just the tiniest bit of effort) - and that service offers practically 0 value in their life over the long term. So long as consumers keep spending their money on superfluous subscriptions &amp; services, we will not see any end to the fed bringing the hammer down on this economy. There is clearly not enough pain. I project we need at least a 30% decline in subscriptions before we know that people are actually facing hardship in this economy. Given the intense rate increases we've seen, we might even be looking at a 50% decline in subscriptions. There is clearly too much free money available in this economy. I honestly don't know what else to say here. I feel like the evidence is right in front of our eyes.

2,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised benchmark interest rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point and indicated it will keep hiking well above the current level. In its quest to bring down inflation running near its highest levels since the early 1980s, the central bank took its federal funds rate up to a range of 3%-3.25%, the highest it has been since early 2008 following the third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move. The increases that started in March and from a point of near-zero mark the most aggressive Fed tightening since it started using the overnight funds rate as its principal policy tool in 1990. The only comparison was in 1994, when the Fed hiked a total of 2.25 percentage points; it would begin cutting rates by July of the following year. Along with the massive rate increases, Fed officials signaled the intention of continuing to hike until the funds level hits a terminal rate, or end point of 4.6% in 2023. The dot plot of individual members expectations doesnt point to rate cuts until 2024; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues have emphasized in recent weeks the unlikelihood that rate cuts will happen next year, as the market had been pricing. Federal Open Market Committee members indicate they expect the rate hikes to have consequences. The funds rate on its face addresses the rates that banks charge each other for overnight lending, but it bleeds through to many consumer adjustable-rate debt instruments, such as home equity loans, credit cards and auto financing. In their quarterly updates of estimates for rates and economic data, officials coalesced around expectations for the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4% by next year from its current 3.7%.

1,"Disclaimer: We have a long position in Fisker Inc; this post is for educational purposes only and is not investment advice Keeping it short (and sweet) - feel free to ping questions below, happy to elaborate. **Company Background** Pure-play BEV OEM with start of production set for 17th November 2022 - they are asset-light (they don't own warehouses nor production sites), and the company is headed by Henrik Fisker (better known as the designer behind the Aston Martin DB9, DB8 Vantage, and the BMW Z8). **Thesis** 1- Best-in-class price point - Fisker's first model (the Ocean) is an all-electric SUV, not too dissimilar to the Tesla Model Y, priced at an extraordinary $30,000 2- Robust demand until 2024 - \~60k reservations (deposits paid) for the Fisker Ocean means supply is likely met until end of 2023, creating a highly visible sales/earnings stream that will help fund future vehicle roll-outs 3- Exciting roadmap - with two known projects in the pipeline (P.E.A.R, a small 'smart-mobility' vehicle, of which are very popular in China - and RONIN, a high-end sports vehicle with a price point \~$100k), Fisker are not only strategically expanding their addressable market, but they are also diversifying from the hyper-popular BEV SUV market that is very 'in' now but is likely to be flooded with supply in the next 2-3 years. **Valuation** Lowest NTM EV/Sales of closest peers by a significant margin, most likely due to liquidity concerns that we think are overbaked. If Fisker were to trade in-line with peers, we would need to see the share price 3x, putting our PT around $20. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/yn14ev8qmfp91.png?width=306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85e12443ed54060df1f7040f612d0eb6c26b03d5 **Risks** Liquidity - there are concerns around whether Fisker may need a future equity raise - we think the $850m in cash currently on the balance sheet will be enough to finance the Ocean rollout, and see potential for proceeds here to support the P.E.A.R rollout in late 23. Supply chain - dominant across most OEMs but exacerbated by Fisker's entirely outsourced Bill-of-Materials. &amp;#x200B; Thanks."

The fed knows that expectations are just as important as the actual rate hikes, which is why jpow became volker incarnate at jackson hole. But with their flip flopping in the past, and dovish track record, will he really follow through on his word? I think so, but they may act too slow, as they alrdy have been.

If he didn't, that means the added boost of regards everywhere gobbling up the very limited number of BBBY shares (similar to GME pre-split of \~70-80mil) would push this thing past what he thought was reasonable ie; 80C.

1,"Investing in meme stocks alone is unique by itself. I think we all have an opportunity to invest in things that we either cared about when we were younger or things we enjoy doing. Im might speak out of turn here, but I look at the recovery of Six Flags stock and Im like damn, missed a 5 bagger and it was right there in front of me the whole time. Or you take any business environment that has been disrupted by COVID and some have been quicker to recover than others. Im presenting the bullish case for AMC to be a COVID recovery play and not so much a squeeze play. Granted there are ways in which it could squeeze, but they have been speculation thus far. We have no way knowing the conditions truthfully without data or facts to back it up. Most of what I have seen borders on conspiracy and this is an effort to clear the air. Invest in what you care about! I went to AMC Theaters last Saturday and I had a blast watching Nobody. I got my popcorn, my blue slurpee, and my sour patch kids. I enjoyed my experience. Thats what I paid $50 for. To take my GF and I out to get out of the house and engage in an activity. AMC presents an opportunity to not just invest in something you care about, but also actively contribute to the wellbeing of the company. In so many words you can support your investment by having fun and enjoying the movie going experience. Yes this applies to other theater stocks. But I like AMC, it reminds me of my childhood. AMC has debt. That is a well known factor of this stock. I dont know expressly know their current debt amount, but with people returning to theaters it can recover. I did the math and if everyone in this group on average spent $50 on one movie go including tickets, food, and drink, it would be about $450M if everyone went to the theaters on the same day. Is that realistic? Probably not, but could be a possibility. Imagine with COVID restrictions being lifted later this year what it could do for generating profits? Well you might say, the movie industry is dying. I dont think it is because you pay for an experience to do something fun with your kids, friends, or your wifes boyfriend. I still think regardless of a squeeze play, it can be a recovery play. With or without a squeeze I am bullish and confident in AMC recovering from COVID and moving past the debt hurdle. I like movies and I like the stock!"

So far what I had thought of is to put leveraged etfs x3 of technology (TQQQ) and oil, and also gold to compensate in times of downturns, what I do not know is what percentage I should have in each, I had also thought to cover drawdowns with futures or inverse etfs. What advice do you have to do this without blow the account?"
1,$HBI Hanes Brands Inc is a very good business with low debt a high dividend a $600 million buy back authorization. They own the Champion brand &amp; are a recession proof business with great cash flow &amp; is trading at multi year lows. If youre looking for the chance to buy a stock and hold it for the next few years and pull high levels of dividend income and capital appreciation this is a great candidate. The January 2025 $7 Call Options trade at around $2.15 and are a great shorter term trade. I anticipate this will be $9-$10 within a year and you can sell a $10 or $12 call poor mans covered call to recover some premium or generate some income while holding the option to expiration. I know the market is scary right now but this one is solid.

0,The answer to a 15 year time line is - of course you will always be up. Where I dont buy some of the conventional wisdom is blindly buy because it will certainly be up then. Lets just say for example purposes only- Aapl is at $500 in 15 years. If you have 100k to invest you do OK if you buy Aapl at $150. But you do substantially better if you wait until the bottoms and buy it at $90.
2,"I fucked up... this whole thing was fucked up. I jumped the BBBY train at 14$, sold shortly after to move to a top mover of that day to get my portfolio out of the negative. After i was even i jumped on BBBY again at 17$. At 26$ i could have realised 10k profit but i believed in the hype, so i did hold all i had. Then the first big dip down to 19$ happened. I put in my last 3k of liquidity i had left and bought more shares. The next day everything went total downhill.I sold at around 10$ to use momentum of another stock to regain some of that loss. Later bought back in to BBBY at 11$. In total i invested 18k into this and i am now almost 10k down. I lost hope BBBY will recover near 20$ from this.. I set up my stop loss at 8,50$ for BBBY so i can at least get my absolute emergency savings out before i am left with 2k in cash. I saved hard for that money the last 2 years and its all gone in 2 days.I feel like i got a kick to my stomach and realized no possible gain from that gamble is worth that feeling.I knew what i was getting into, but it was promising and really tempting for success.

1,"Hi all, I made a simple analysis about $VEON shares. Total shares is 1.75B %47.9 is owned by L1 %8.3 is owned by The Stichting (Dutch legal entity) %43.8 is owned by the other shareholders (Institutional Investors, Mutual Funds, Retails) When checking the 2022 Q1 SEC fillings, we could calculate the distribution of %43.8 **%15.48 - Institutional Investors** **%1.55 - Mutual Funds** **%26.77 - Retails (us)** The current manipulation of the price is done by Institutional Investors. Mutual Funds are more passive holders. **The avg price paid by Institutional Investors for $VEON stock is $1.757** With current price, Institutional Investors will not sell with that much loss. (Some already sold, but the remaining ones who haven't sold yet will not sell.) Mutual funds is passive, will not sell. %15.48 vs %26.77, Retail has much more share than Institutional Investors. All in all, **- If there occurs a Retail Interest, this will be a potential high flyer stock like MEME stock.** **- One big difference, it has very very solid fundamentals than any potential MEME stock.** \- **Which MEME stock has Price/Earnings around 1.5** \- **Which MEME stock has Price/Sales around 0.10** **- Which MEME stock has given dividends** **That is $VEON**"

1,The facts are pretty clear here. The stock market is shit. Even good companies are getting shit on by hedge fund and Hanes Brands Inc ($HBI) is no different. Even though they pay a strong dividend of 7.6% &amp; have a very low PE of 7 with solid cash flow &amp; decent leverage of 3.0 the shares are some of the most borrowed by hedge funds to drive into the ground. $HBI owns the Champion brand which is loved globally and is considered ultra premium in China &amp; Korea. Hanes also has been known for its exclusive t-shirt partnership with Michael Jordan &amp; its the inventor of the tag-less tee shirt. The business model itself is so attractive that Berkshire Hathaway owns competitor Fruit of the Loom outright. (Buyout target)? At under $8/share $HBI is a generational buy. Buy it to hold. Buy it for the dividend. Buy it for the short term trade. Buy it to pressure the hedge funds into capitulation. Buy the calls or buy the Jan 2025 LEAPS. Just buy it.

0,"I deposited money to bring it up to $26,300 and I will be depositing another $900 once Robinhood sends the funds to my bank. I switched over to using Webull. The settled funds I have are actually $24,000, the other $2,300 are just the instant buying power I have for now until the funds settle in Webull. I see no reason for my bank or webull to reverse the pending deposits, and never had that happen to me before. it says I have unlimited day trades. So I am assuming that I am in the clear to trade unlimitedly, even though my settled funds are actually $24,000. Recently found out that the moment the account falls below $25,000 you violate the PDT rule, I thought you just go back to 3 trades a week but I was wrong. What else is there to know? I'd rather learn with real money than paper trade, even a $500 loss in a week is nothing serious to me. But what I cannot accept is a loss greater than $5,000, but I'm not going that crazy, at least not yet. a $5,000 gain or loss is around 20% or so of my account value, I am aiming for 1%-5% in a week at least."

1,"I have to say that I didn't understand why BBBY is booming and was reluctant as well. However, it seems it is the play rn. I just wanna mention that in April there was a stock squeezing (can't mention the ticker because it's below 1B cap, but it's delisted now). The short interest was above 100% due to a merger. That stock ran from $2 to $18 and I had long calls but guess what they did? Yup, they made all options close only so no one could buy calls or puts options claiming that not enough shares are available and they sold the options by mistake. My options were around $1 and went to $0.05 in a single day. Nothing happened to the market makers and they killed the gamma squeeze and the ticker is delisted as of a week ago.Even though options are tasty as f$ck, I just wanna say be careful, they will do everything in and outside of the book to kill this rally. Have to say I don't have a position as of right now due to lack of cash (soon I'll get it)."

2,"With the Fed removing ""any remaining doubts about its commitment"" to strongly tackle extremely high inflation, Morgan Stanley's top equity strategist Michael Wilson is increasingly confident in his prediction that U.S. stocks are yet to hit the real bottom. The strategist sees both stocks and bonds taking ""another leg lower"" in response to the growth trajectory in earnings and the economy, as well as the strong dollar. ""While hard to predict such ""events,"" the conditions are in place for one, which would help accelerate the end to this bear market,"" Wilson told clients in a note. Wilson also sees an ""untenable situation for risk assets"" for risk assets given the soaring U.S. dollar, which could prompt ""a financial or economic crisis, or both."" Morgan Stanley strategists have a $118 price target on the dollar index (DXY), which suggests more upside. ""On a year over year basis, the DXY is now up 21% and still rising. Based on our analysis that every 1% change in the DXY has around a -0.5% impact on S&amp;P 500 earnings, 4Q S&amp;P 500 earnings will face an approximate 10% headwind to growth all else equal,"" the strategist added. Morgan Stanley's top strategist also sees accelerating negative earnings revision in the next 1-2 months, a development that should facilitate the next log lower in stocks. ""We remain highly convicted in our view that the bear market in stocks will not be over until the S&amp;P 500 reaches the range of our Base and Bear case tactical targets i.e.,3000-3400, later this fall,"" Wilson concluded.

Where before the value of AMC overall could be accounted for using AMC shares, it now takes into account both APE and AMC to ascertain the value of AMC overall. This means the value of the ordinary shareholder will be diluted if they go ahead with this offering. Shareholders voted no to further offerings of AMC, which prevented them from directly offering those shares but in a world where the value of AMC has changed. They have basically achieved the same thing. Since shareholders voted against further dilution without any result, why are people happy with this?

This could be in a quarter or in a year. Then invest heavily, as in 80% of my portfolio, into only TQQQ. If a person had done this in April 2020 (when TQQQ was at $16) and held until a couple months once the market began to go down (February 2022 and sold at $55) you would still have a nice gain. Some people out there would say price decay, which is something I do not totally understand tbh... I am more than okay with loosing almost all of my money. I am 29 and can easily make back all that I will invest in TQQQ (which would be $20k). I would cash out if/when we have a bad 6 to 7 week period. That could be in a year after investing or a decade... Let the downvotes come. Tell me why I should not do this... I see this market continuing downward, but slowly and not sharply. I see us having a good **2024** and would probably put my $20k into TQQQ over the course of a few weeks. Say we have a good 2 consecutive weeks, put in $15k. Regardless if the next 2 weeks are good or bad after that, dip in with the remaining $5k (either I buy more per share or I get a slight discount if the market should dip)."

2,"If you ask 90% of people what drives stock prices, most of them will say things like earnings, PE ratios, forward guidance. The reality is that none of these things matter today. In today's market, factors such as earnings, PE ratios, and forward guidance play almost NO ROLE in the price action of a company's stock. The number one driver of stock prices is the price action taking place in the debt market. In fact, the stock market as a whole derives its value from action in the debt market meaning that the stock market is a derivative of the debt market itself. To drive this point home, let's look at what central banks have been doing since the 2008 financial meltdown. They've been artificially suppressing interest rates, and it's worked really well in inflating another huge stock and real estate bubble. Low interest rates that are artificially suppressed by central banks create an environment of risk, as cash is forced into riskier assets such as stocks. This also drives up the price of real estate. In addition, this suppression of rates has robbed savers of trillions of dollars in wealth by keeping savings rates below the actual rate of inflation. The global inflation and freefalling economy today are a direct result of central banks artificially suppressing rates for years following the last major meltdown. Central banks are responsible for the global financial and economic systems, both of which are inextricably connected. Moreover, central banks working in concert are deliberately driving the world right into a financial/economic crisis of truly epic proportions. Central banks have been deliberately and meticulously working to hyperinflate a global debt bubble. Cracks in this bubble are now beginning to show, particularly in the form of rapidly rising global bond yields. This in turn is putting pressure on global stock prices. It is only a matter of time before an extreme sell-off in the debt market occurs. But a stock market crash- even one of this size- is the smallest issue. The real problem is a worldwide financial system shutdown, which means ALL TRANSACTIONS STOP. There would be no cash available from banks, credit cards and ATM cards would be unusable, no lending, everything would come to a halt. Do not be mistaken, central banks are working intentionally towards this inescapable end of the current system(s) only to usher in a new system that they have much more control over where, when and how much of their product Central Bank Currencies ie: ( USD, CAD, AXY, JXY, BXY) you can spend.

2,"Green day in the market will most likely equal a red day for GME &amp; AMC. If youre in it for the cause then hold! If youre in it for profit, get ready to sell or lose some money today. If you cannot afford to lose money, dont keep buying more. This could lead to a big recession and thats not something our economy needs at the moment. ONLY RISK, what you can afford to lose. Dont let peoples decision in here, manipulate yours. Especially if youre a new investor. Theres a bull and bear market. Surely bears will rip you new investors apart. Majority of the people in here are trying to make a profit. NEW INVESTORS. Dont let FOMO take over. Prices for both AMC &amp; GME are very high and at their peak. We dont know for sure if there is another short squeeze. Short interest is below 100% which isnt good. This could plummet tomorrow, nobody knows. New investors, Im just trying to look out for you guys. Stocks dont just go up, they go down. Best of luck."

0,"Cathie Woods Ark Invest launched a new venture capital fund, targeting individual investors with a minimum investment of just $500. The actively managed ARK Venture Fund invests in 70% private companies and 30% public firms focused on technologically enabled innovation, and selectively in other venture capital funds, the company said Tuesday. The fund is available to individual investors initially through investing app Titan, a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz. We are doubling down on innovation, Wood said in an interview on CNBCs Squawk Box Tuesday. Ark is moving from social media and social marketing into social distribution, direct to consumer. Pretty exciting. We are offering investors something theyve not been able to access before. The ARK Venture Fund charges a flat management fee of 2.75%, and does not charge any carried interest or load fees. The total expense ratio of the fund is estimated to be 4.22%, Ark said.

Set slippage to 7% when buying3. $PYRO liquidity is locked for 2 years and will be extended for 600+ years4. The value of the remaining $PYRO increases when the supply burns5.

When the LSE opens today investors who are worried about the future of the UK (and they should be with what Krazy Kwazi is doing) will sell pushing the LSE down and also devaluing the GBP further. At this point we will hit dollar parity, which will scare investors more and cause even more downward pressure. Don't overcommit, but there's an opportunity here for brave people.

However, the uninformed could construe this terrible behavioral outburst as a reflection of $BBBY, which we do not deserve since Gustavo at his worst was a criminal awaiting a billion dollar lawsuit. If this stock goes down because of him, we should all go spit on his grave. What do you think? Will $BBBY rise or fall?"

Its one thing to do it like AA did at the freaking peak of the price. But its another do do it today. We will likely find out soon if AMC is truly a tool to hedge the meme stock basket if the price randomly runs before the sales are complete. GameStop on the other hand is down cash but up inventory to nearly equal parts. Im not a finance major and Im sure people will pull out some BS financial terms but thats just how I see it. The only reason in my opinion that GameStop is down since August is explained by XRT hitting the threshold list last week. When they cant use the stock they use the ETFs. But thats just a can kick. More to come but dilution is not on GameStops agenda especially at the freaking lows.

1,Okay lets start off with explaining what this company does. Xeris Pharma is a biotech company that makes reverse diabetes medicine. Essentially when your blood sugar gets to low. U can take their drug and you wont die. They are also working on some other technology which you can read up on their website. Xeris at its current rate will be cash flow positive by 2022. They have hundreds of millions in cash while the market cap is only 300 million. On top of that the short interest is about 35% and the short borrow rate(the interest you pay for borrowing a stock to short) is nearly 40%. and their is almost now shares to short left. (We bull has disabled shorting on xers) The strong fundamentals combined with a potential short squeeze could make the company worth 3-4 billion going off the past short squeezes that have happened in other similar companies. That could mean a 10x or even possibly a 20x play if we can drive this up to a price where a short covering recursion loop occurs.
0,"Look at TSLA, that's how the bastard algos did it."
0,"The probability of GameStop issuing shares is low (not 0%, but definitely not 100%), especially given the fact that they plan on integrating IMX/FTX into their platform sooner than later (their IMX 8-K from earlier this year implies a Q4/Q1 2023 release, barring any extensions, which they have not filed for). I also think if they were to dilute further (let's not forget the barrel of cash they raised in 2021), they would have done so already. They're not hurting for cash, and they certainly plan on having some sort of viable income beyond brazenly fleecing their shareholders. Out of all the memes, GameStop is probably the best one to play. Not because of a ""squeeze"" but because of the potential for an actual turn around (is it a meme at that point? This is a question I ask myself a lot). Theatres, while still a very pleasant/enjoyable experience, aren't the novelty they were (even a few years ago). Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is pretty much irrelevant/dead in the greater home improvement/consumer retail space (even if they can somehow save themselves from bankruptcy plenty of department stores provide nearly everything they do and more). If GameStop can pull off their vision they will be filling a unique niche in the US (and perhaps globally) which will go a long way. That's worth something."

0,"I tried reporting my old employer in Arizona for using PPP Money to buy a brand new boat, a new RV and a rental property, on top of never paying overtime or paying the crew a check when they all tested positive. Called like 15 different people. Filled out 30 pages of paperwork.. spent 3 weeks and finally just gave up since it was obvious I had to do their job for them and still wasnt going to get the money owed to us"

0,"LOL what? I genuinely don't understand why people like you bother with such illogical explanations. &gt; you could spend 48 million easily in a weekend, just buy a house in LA with a yacht and docking feels. There goes your 48 million I'm not sure if you're aware, but houses and yachts can be sold. If he managed to buy a $30m house and $15m+ on yachting shit the majority of that could be easily recouped. He's not going to be begging to turn $2 million back into $50 million. Sell both of those and the majority of his wealth would be back."
2,https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/09/06/bed-bath-beyond-shares-decline-after-cfos-death.html Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond were down Tuesday after the struggling retailer's chief financial officer died over the weekend.
2,No one has talked about this stock for a while.The stock is down 90% from IPO. Management has not been able to get control of this downward spiral. Terrible IPO timing for what they sell. I have closed out a lot of my position over the lasted 12 months due to margin calls. I still own a few thousand shares. The company valuation is now less than its annual revenue. Heavily shorted by WS. The company does have a great content library and needs a streaming distribution deal to reverse this trajectory. It would take 14 days to cover the short float. Anyone agree on the potential short Squeeze here?
0,You can say that about the whole stock market in general lmao

0,...as I still think $XELA is a trash stock and trash company with a trash CEO. Have no idea why it was trending on here last week. But this post here kind of brings me back to the time when DFV stuck his DD to the scumbag MMs. https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1542234036445147141.html Good times.
0,Looking at the 5 year chart on SQQQhow bad was the economy in 2019? I was still in highschool and knew nothing about anything (similar to now) lol
0,Will try to add the link but saw this in a YouTube video and thought it was interesting after they announced big losses recently. https://youtu.be/0hESM87uIok
1,"Most of the stocks I buy are nonsense. &amp;#x200B; But today, I picked up 2 shares of NVDA as part of a plan to move my portfolio more into long term investments. With the announcement that the US is no longer letting Nvidia sell AI chips to China, it's become clear that the world's largest military now sees Nvidia as a security asset. And we all know how the US likes to pick winners. &amp;#x200B; But more broadly, I expect an AI goldrush at some point in the next few decades. Maybe sooner given how clearly afraid the US are of the technology's real and upcoming future. And who makes the most during a gold rush? The people selling the pick-axes. So yeah. It's a fair bit lower than it probably should be right now, for a LOT of reasons, a fair number of them quite legitimate. But I do believe that nvidia will recover, and I'm fairly certain that in the medium to long term future this will be a cash cow."
2,"Theres your pump, get put with the profit"
1,If any bears wanna out there bag down below after tommorow please leave a comment thank you come again BBBY to the moon fuck this shills
2,vix dropping fast
2,"This is for those of you who lost on BBBY. It's part of taking risks that sometimes you will lose in the stock market. It happens. Don't get discouraged, just start investing in multiple stocks and learn from mistakes. The stock market is legal gambling so these things will happen. Also know that you can use capital losses on your taxes ($3000 a year). It sucks to lose but it's not the end of the world."
0,Your problem is you weren't born rich.
0,They're going to close the day flat for maximum profit on premiums. The only way to play options right now is to play LEAPS.
2,I got boned by firm when I bought my amc shares (beginners luck) and now Im sitting on a loss. Have been since just before the surge. I cant make up my mind. Are we done with AMC? Do I take my licks and learn from them or am I holding for dear lifestill?
2,"I don't gamble most of my puts are NovemberI have about 15 puts, I may lose on 1Rblx 10/21 30 strike"
2,"Fellow apes, sorry about the BBBY losses we had but why don't we buy palantir? It is down a heck of a lot, I mean from in the 30$ to only 8$ with huge upside potential, and only because Karp says it isnt generating tendies till 2025? 6% sold short so no short squeeze this time boys. Im a palantard for life! (until im down working behind a Wendy's dumpster giving hj for 5$) &amp;#x200B; ps. the amount of rockets represent my confidence 10/10"
2,Is it game over for AMC? Will trade first born for hope.
0,"Yardi Matrix projections showing investor owner SFR volumes at 40% by 2030. The institutional investor buy up strategy just really got going during Covid. Its in full swing and not really stopping. Watch reit owned MF properties in urban cores incentivizing renters with rent reductions, shorter term options, lax credit requirements and financed deposits. Theyre trying to draw capable buyers out of the exurban SF market."

1,What are your thoughts on shares for hertz. They seem to agree that bankruptcy is no longer on the table. Share is cheap and increased more than 120% last couple weeks!
0,"I guess despite the reputation of WSB many in here do simple investing like me: DCA into some ETFs (with low fees) with a relatively long time horizon. The beauty of this approach is it's simplicity: you don't assume you are smarter than anyone, you just have one underlying assumption: in the long run, the economy is always growing. While was true for the last 100 years and will most probably also be true for the next 10, 20 years I'm wondering if this is also true for 30+ years - I'm 35 now so that's more or less the time span I'm concerned with. In contrast to other events that could kill the economy (nuclear war, asteroid, large volcano) the climate change doesn't have a occurrence probability somewhere on the long tail of the distribution - it's rather close to 100%. Now I'm not worried for the humanity as a race, we will most probably persist (although in much smaller numbers). But I'm definitely worried about the effect on the markets once massive droughts, heat waves and flooding happen. The exact effect on the economy might be hard to calculate, but given what we saw in 2022 (e.g. the drought in China) I expect them to be rather large. Now we might argue about the time frame: is it something we can expect by 2100? Latest IPCC reports say we will see the consequences much before. Therefore, and without any political agenda - strictly looking at the markets, my question to fellow DCA-into-ETF investors: What's your take on this issue? How do you factor this risk into your strategy?"
1,SPY above 400$ soo...Green Friday tomorrow?
2,"i managed to make on my shorts, bought shares at 1pm and watched it all dissappear cause thats how i roll"
0,"AMD, NVIDIA or Intel right now? Thoughts, Opinions, Predictions, etc all welcome - This is not an advise post, just a pick your brain and let me see what the community thinks before I personally choose one of them to dump into. Thoughts between them below, given the recent 4090 BS, EVGA partnership loss, AMDs supposed amazing GPUs coming soon, Intel's upcoming chips, etc. I think AMD is going to come out strong toward the end of this year into next year - Between the BS nvidia has done with the 40 series and the (hopefully) amazing price to performance that amd is reportedly bringing, plus the uplift the new ryzen chips are getting compared to intel.... yeah i feel like AMD is in a position to really increase it's market share by massive amounts on both fronts. I don't see a recovery plan for NVIDIA right now given the inflation and TSMC price increases ontop of the cost to produce the 40 series AND the backlog of 30 series cards lol.... As for Intel, eh idk i just feel like ryzen is going to top the charts this time around and intel will struggle to keep up - In regards to price to performance specifically, but that is left to be seen."
0,How do i find companies that are new so i can get in on the IPO (initial public offering) so i can get out of my shitty 9-5? I was thinking that all new companies soar when they start so i just get in on it early and make a bunch of money. I just dont know where to find new companies. Anything helps. thank you :)
0,"That may be true, but theres more to life than money. The long-term cost of fossil fuels usage are far greater than green energy, and its pretty high time that we start considering that."
1,The price has fallen its a great time to get back into GME if you sold and made your money! We need to get the price back up because theres no way these shorts have covered Edit: Start* buying GME again!!
2,With rising interest rates we could see a downturn in the Vancouver housing market which could be seen coming for over 10 years. I dont have any positions but might be worth looking into. https://www.shuswaphomes.com/blog/u-s-short-sellers-betting-on-canadian-housing-crash/
1,Since the market opened today I've had the same song on repeat but as soon as I changed it the market gods became enraged and dropped everything. But don't worry! It's back on repeat and we are back on track to the moon! Hodl and buy more before full recovery apes! Worst comes to worst we'll need to sacrifice a few goats to appease them further but it should be fine now.

1,"https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/vnmk3p Bbby might be getting knocked down, but personally I believe it will get up again. RC agrees. PS: MSM is spinning the ceo ousting as a negative thing but it was literally what RC has been gunning for. He has a plan to spinoff buy buy baby and chewify it"
2,"At least the business has a chance of being a going concern in that case. BBBY is fundamentally disrupted and poorly operated. GME is even more fundamentally disrupted and has burned all its windfall cash spinning its wheels over nonsense. AMC at least offers something that customers uniquely want. Still a terrible investment, but I respect the CEO's hustle to grift these people of every windfall dollar he can before the craze disappears."
1,Best bargain right NOW! Lets go folks!!!!!!!! &amp;#x200B; ALL IN
0,What would be a first investment that you would recommend as well as a good way to learn? I dont have a few grand but I do have $100 to $200 that I can play around with. Ive been looking on Coinbase and all of it looks so scary
0,Anyone know what just happened with TWTR cant find news or anything but all of a sudden millions of shares bought after days of silence?
1,"Buying more BBBY raises the price Keeping the price above the call strike price(s) makes us more money All that money we make allows us to buy more shares Buying more shares allows us to safely buy more calls Buying more calls incentivizes us to buy more shares so the price keeps going up The more the price goes up, the more tendies we eat Simpel"
2,If anyone on this sub ever feels [redacted]. I want you to know one thing: Somewhere out there is a person who bought at 2-4% . And theyre gonna refinance sometime in the near future at 6-9% on the same (most likely) overpriced home. Itll make someone holding BBBY look like an idiot savant.
0,"Can you imagine, after GME the new thing had to be: every ape leave the market, sell them all out, leave forever, leave the whales suck each other dik instead of fracking your a$$. Ohhh what a world would be."
0,GME has earrings this week and is it down to $27 is it a good idea to do a call option before the announcement and a put option when it announces?
1,"I get that GME was an attempt to stick it to hedge funders, but is this more of a lets see if we can do this? And ape together strong kinda thing? Dont get me wrong this has been incredibly amusing to watch unfold with you smooth brained regarded apes, but Im trying to see if Im missing something lol Inb4: We like the stock"
1,Anyone have a view on $MREO? I own it and thinking of adding. Stock has more than doubled off the bottom and there is chatter of a takeout...Valuation and fundamentals still look very cheap and excellent.
0,Due to the most recent news about HF bankruptcy etc. I began to think about what if this happened to one of the big market makers in the USA. Let's take citadel for example. I believe they handle something like 30+% of all trades for the market. Who fills this void should someone this large go away? Could the system even survive something this big? Any input would be nice.
0,"What percentage of Nvidia profit is originated by people who buy cards for mining ? I assume there is no ""exact"" number that nvidia publishes, but are there estimates ? I can't seem to find them. I assume that if it is a large portion of their profit, they will be impacted very badly, as etherum moved finally from Proof of work to Proof of stake. And everyone in the mining community sells their cards at a very low price."
0,"Wall Street bets are by the people and for the people, I used to hear a professor stating don't chase the money, only follow it. I heard whispers of a social media outlet, that the public can sell their Non-fungible token . and make a lot of money on the app. but all it needs is an influencer, or clout to bring to the masses. I don't care about their coin, but the platform is a goldmine. its called xungible"
2,"Bidu took a massive hit from the recent sell off, its tradinf at 221 now, I think it will go back to its previous highs back in 300 very soon. PLTR on the other hand has demo day coming April 16th. What do u guys think? Lookimg at Jan 21 2022 LEAPS only - 10-12k Position most likely."
2,VIX inversion finally went away and i thought some puts could print. Hope I'm not wrong lol.
1,The shorts cost to borrow is too high apes! Deliver the final blow and squeeze these bears out. Pushhh
2,I thought spy was looking regarded then I looked at hood. Thats the real regard
1,"I made a 446% gain on bbby ($232-$1268) before selling since it started to crash and now Im feeling some more fomo kick in my blood stream. How regarded would I be to buy in now? I have 9,050 shares of gnus and I do believe I will get atleast a 150% gain within the next 6-12months but those short term quick gains are looking very tasty in $bbby and the fomo is killing me. Im wondering if there are still apes out there holding shares. I saw multiple posts regarding how $bbby was still pumping to $30 while Ryan was selling his shares and that gives me hopium."
0,"I've been eyeing an Australian stock that's at 6 per share, but Fidelity and Edward Jones won't let me purchase unless it is over a dollar per share. Which defeats the purpose of getting in on the ground level with this investment. Any ideas on how to make this purchase? Google isn't very helpful."
0,are people being murdered on CNBC right now?
0,If the Fed is always buying high and selling low arent we just handing traders money? and causing inflation?
1,"BBBY's strategic update today has led to the share price to drop below $9. Currently we are sitting at $9.00-$9.50 and have been all day. To alot of people this is nothing more than an opportunity. Why you ask? 1. Today BBBY announced 1 billion dollar in loans thay the company has aquired. Providing a lifeline for the next 6 months. What does this mean? 6 months of no bankruptcy fear 2. BBBY unveiled a plan to target market additional age groups and boosting their inventory atance up by 20%. More inventory + Better marketing= more sales 3. Lastly, they are closing 150 of their non profit stores. Saving them 250 million in overhead cost At worst this stock becomes big lots. Which is down today and at a $22 share price. So tell me, why are you not buying BBBY?"

1,"EXPR- 1 week candlesticks- is breaking out of the same pattern that AMC broke out of that sent it from below 14 to 72. This one is going to squeeze above 20 in a short amount of time. Brought it up 2 days ago where I compared the charts.

The float is tiny, we just need heavy volume and HOLD!!"
2,I made 36k on my SLV calls... Cashed those in prematurally hopping to pick them up cheaper end of day since all US did was sanctions... Using those profits in SPY/IWM puts 0DTE. This seems top heavy now at resistance.
1,Sentiment is quite positive
2,"Anybody been looking at 3Ms troubles lately? 13 lawsuits cost 175 million so far, with 230,000 lawsuits to go. I dont think they make it out of this unscathed, considering the judge told them no bankruptcy. I think they will be going down hard. NFA."
2,Stress is killing me should I dump the lot?
2,"BBBY sells nothing unique. You can buy everything they sell at WMT, TGT, or AMZN. The only hope is for them to be bought out. Bezos buys it and turns them into fulfillment centers/return centers/ shop Amazon stores"
0,"California is special in the fact that it produces more in tax revenue than the Federal Govt provides it. So they essentially have a surplus to draw from. I dont agree with it but i dont think this is Federal money, its the states."

1,"Not sure if many of you heard but tomorrow gamestop has a meeting with third bridge media to discuss how they will move forward with e-commerce and other business ideas. Not expecting anything crazy but last time we saw gamestop have a interview with the same media outlet back in 2020 we saw a huge rise in volume and price. Again, not expecting anything dramatic but who knows we might see different ideas presented forward that were held off during earnings due to the fact that hedge funds knew exactly that we were expecting earnings to be a great day for us and they completely fucked that for us. I think gamestop was smart enough and we might see some crazy shit happen tomorrow during that afternoon. Godspeed and to the moon apes. NOT ADVICE AND NOT A PREDICTION. JUST A RETARD WHO LIKES THE STOCK."

2,I've been investing for 3 years now since I started my job as an Account Manager and have come to the realisation that I may as well have given all the money I invested away to children in need or used it to heat my house (would work out cheaper then electric) instead of the black whole of the stock market
2,JPOW going to give us one of the best motivational speeches ever delivered while I have puts open.
2,"So going into into a long weekend, do you guys think there's a big chance for a real downturn on tuesday? Historically iirc many of the worst falls has happened after a prolonged closed stock exchange. With rate hikes on the menu, right now 86.2 percent change of next hike being .75 increase, and worries of recession with lowest consumer sentiment since, well, ever, I just can't see much positive on the horizon. I'm thinking of buying SPY puts/FDs today, but I was wondering what you guys think? Premarket SPY is +0.53 % and VIX is down 2.7 %, so it doesn't look like people are worried."

2,"Unless you've been living under a rock and only buying GME and BBBY 0DTE calls, you're probably aware of strike talks that are happening in the US regarding rail freight. The US absolutely depends on rail to run smoothly as it is a large part of getting stuff across the country. As rail fails to meet demands, many businesses will turn to trucking and road transport, where there is already a shortage of drivers. Supply chain will crumble. Businesses will bleed money and become powerless. Thoughts?"

1,"$QTNT Simple really. They were scheduled for earnings on the 22nd, popped over 100% and then fell back to lows upon earnings rescheduling for tomorrow early AM. I rarely advocate for investing in penny stocks and earnings plays, but I am all in this time.

Ive never been a WSB conspiracy theorist that the hedges are trying to get us to pump and dump, but theres definitely some people who are trying to manipulate the community. Yes I know hold gainz dont come in one day. Just was curious if the short interest had really dried up or if the squeeze had been squooze."
1,"Lemonade $LMND close to closing on $MILE Sales 31% Float Shorted. Apes squeeze this lemonade and force shorty to cover like $GME GameStop Lemonade Insurance $LMND has over 31% of their float shorted. We've seen this at $GME and others that have been attached by Short Sellers. $PRU and GEICO, State Farm are all fat cat insurance providers that are ready to be cannibalized and disrupted by $LMND Lemonade. The Gross loss Ratio is distorted but as Metromile $MILE acquisition is closed $LMND any day the power of bundled insurance product offering and quickly scale. The market size is tremendous trillions for auto insurance alone. Only 3% market absorption makes $LMND a home run. LMND spends 10% of legacy providers like State Farm, Allstate, Liberty Mutual, GEICO, and $PRU to acquire new customers via AI Digital Platform. Legacy provides run stupid commercials on TV day and night The numbers or market size to be disrupted are staggering and it is just matter of time before $LMND delivers tremendous efficiency not only in acquiring legacy customers but delivering a solution and customer service that is far superior at greater margins then legacy providers. Shorty will run for the hills as the numbers come in. $LMND pps prior to shorty was 180/share, now it can be bought for est 20/share."
1,"Hello apes, today I wanted to talk about lowering your cost basis. If you bought GME, BB, AMC at the peak, then get your smooth brains ready because this is for you. One method to lowering cost basis is selling covered calls. This is pretty self explanatory and generally works well. However, here is the better way. Say you have 100 shares at $250 but the stock is trading at $190. Close your entire position and rebuy the shares, and boom! Cost basis reduced to $190. Works 100% of the time. Thank me later."

2,"This Sub was created in 2012. We havent had a bear market since 2008. Before that was 2000, before that was 1987, before that the 70s, which did take a while to come back from The bears come out to play about once every 15 years.. 7-8% of the time and go back to hibernate usually around a year or so The question is, will you keep buying the dip eating red crayons, buying worthless memes making newer monthly lows, no fundamentals and no cash to come out of a liquidity crunch or do you have a strategy to take you to Tendie Town. I shake my head and cringe when I read Regards buying the dip and memes or both. I have been trading since 1994. It is time to pivot and wait for greener pastures for the Bulls to come out and play. Some ideas are puts on high fliers, stuff that lose money and do not have a path to profitability soon. Stuff like SNOW BILL GTLB RBLX AFRM If you do not trade options here are 5 bear ETFs that you can buy shares I havent done Calls on them. I am mainly focused on puts LABD TQQQ SARK SOXS SQQQ Check the charts on these the last few weeks. Or are you going to keep buying dips? Eating red crayons..

2,"tl;dr - needs to get vote to extend (happens at 12PM eastern), which are unlikely to happen. Premarket drop about 20% (big boys think its gonna drop). Short to $10 (share price minimum) Truth social merger is not likely to be extended, if it does it will be bogged down with legal fees and other costs it cannot afford. They reportedly have billions in bills unpaid. Either way it is going down. Currently being propped up by retails who believe in Trump etc. but the big people who premarket dropped this off by 20% this morning premarket. There is a minimum value per share of 10$ but most have bought in much higher than this. As starts to drop rapidly people will shed it. Now is the time to short before the announcement and even if the announcement is positive (merger deadline extended) it will still be a long term short."
0,"Here to open a discussion about a secret the rich don't want you to know. The secret is the huge tax benefits of major losses in your brokerage accounts this year. Say you bought BBBY or GME calls that expire worthless and you lose $100,000. Your brokerage account shows Zero and a total loss. You cry and quit, leaving your gains to be spent by the hedgies and they win! Consider the huge benefits to you in the future from your losses! You now have a $100,000 capital loss that will offset your future gains. You can only deduct $3,000 per year if you stop gambling (see below to see the trick the rich use). The tax savings are 30-50% of your losses, because those losses offset your ordinary taxable income. For example, if your taxable income is $100,000 then your marginal tax bracket would be 24% + State (assume 6%). Your losses reduce your taxable income to $97,000 saving you approximately $900 in taxes. These losses carryforward indefinitely, so consider it a 33 year $900 annuity! To best utilize this strategy and tax savings, you need to generate capital gains. The capital losses offset your gains, so your future gains are tax free up to $100,000. The trick the rich don't want you to know: Consistently make larger and larger bets! Eventually one will pay off and you'll be rich again. Your Lambo is one gamble away."

0,"Take out a large loan, ideally over a million dollars worth. After that, put it into SPX options so that you can triple it. Pay back the loan and now you have profited millions of dollars thanks to options. If your trade fails you just file for bankruptcy and you dont have to pay back the loan. Then after that you can work at Wendys for the rest of your life, then rinse and repeat until your SPX options trade works out"

1,"Its been 21 months since the Sneeze of GME, and in that time the company has completely transformed itself. From a brick and mortar retailer to an ecommerce company with a renewed focus on collectibles and digital asset ownership. The company has raised over a Billion dollars in cash through a stock sale and also boasts a billion dollars in inventory. They retired all debt early and have leased a 700,000 square foot distribution warehouse with plans on leasing more warehouse space in the future. They have an entire section dedicated to PC gaming including peripherals and individual components, with prices comparable or even below that of amazon. They have shut down low performing stores while simultaneously cutting its c-suite bloat, using that money instead as a compensation package for its front line retail workers. They have a board of directors who actually *listen* to their shareholders, and a shareholder base who actively communicates their needs to the board. Their current negative EPS is a direct result of an increased investment in transforming the company; see RCs Chewy interview for his philosophy on growing a business. They have not only created a marketplace for buying and selling digital assets, but have also created their own wallet and been partnering with pioneers in the space such as Loopring, IMX, and most recently FTX. Their *beta* marketplace did more volume in its first 3 days than coinbases marketplace has done in its lifetime. The e t h merge has just happened, reducing the energy cost of transactions by 99.8%. Investors in GME have Directly Registered 23% of the entire company as of GMEs Q3 10-Q. Public short interest currently stands at ~51 million shares or 25% of the float, still extraordinarily high. If Gamestop were in real financial trouble they could issue another stock sale, only 300m of the 1bn authorized shares are currently in the market. Im sure there are a ton of other points Im missing, but extrapolating from their current cash burn GME wont be going bankrupt for at least 5 years , and even then they can issue more shares or take on debt to finance the business."

0,"I am having difficulty understanding the basics of a long vs short position in trading foreign currencies. I know you should take a long position if you expect the currency to rise, and a short position if you expect the currency to fall. The problem is calculating the profit. For example, the British pound appreciated relative to US currency from January 19 to March 16. On January 19 the exchange rate was 1.3644 GBP/USD. On March 16, the exchange rate was 1.3901 GBP/USD. The Pound obviously got stronger. I have to invest $100,000 USD into GBP. This means I could buy 73,292.29 pounds on January 19 and sell for 71,937.27 on March 16. Does this mean I have a profit of 1,355.02 pounds? When I convert this back to USD, the profit should be $974.76 (1,355.02 pounds divided by the current exchange rate of 1.3901). Also, if I took a short position it would be a loss of $974.76? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"

Long story short - can someone explain how to easily calculate the option price for the scenario above or set the stop loss based on the underlying asset price? Until now I have just done this manually, but as I will be busy today I would need this mechanic. Cheers &amp; Thx"
1,"If you sold and hoping to get back on once it starts launching , not a good idea. When GME was launching , buy buttons were removed. Same thing might happen and you'll miss your ride to the moon. Better to buy and hold now. Price right now is a steal. You might not see anything this low again. Once again , dont panic if we are not heading to the moon today. 25% gain in a super red market day is a crazy W. Stay strong apes and chimps. The stock will no doubt explode , just a matter of time. Dont try to predict. Just buy and hold. Hedgefunds havent covered. Market cap is only 2B with lots of room for growth. The fundamentals are all there. Never panic sell. If you are thinking of selling, turn off your phone and come back the next day. That is all. Scratch your hairy asses and be patient fellow apes. Shield wall. VALHALLAH SOON."

SO, if you are a short on BBBY, frankly, there are WAY better opportunities out there to make money shorting. You have a bunch of apes locked and loaded and even mildly positive news on Wednesday is going to send this baby to the moon. Then add reg(shit)sho. It is simply not worth it to be shorting this stock right now. Beginning of last week? Possibly. But right now? Absolutely 100% not.We are goin to the moon boys.

2,"Huge Put option play on AMC over the next week. Last time there was a bull run on the stock got to the same resistance (3/11-3/18) up 42.1% to $14.54 then on 3/19 slight drop of (0.5%) that was followed up by a (10.3%) drop on 3/22 and further drops of (14.7%) on 3/23 and (15.4%) on 3/24. Weve had a run up of 55% from 5/6-5/17 to $14.38 high on 5/17. Slight gain of 0.6% on 5/18 (similar to the slight drop on 3/19 with freaky similar volume changes) and then the massive sell off decline on 5/19 of (9.9%) is eerily similar to the (10.3%) drop on 3/22....... Potential to give up all of the gains since 5/6 by this Friday and puts are ridiculously cheap in the $10 below range for 5/21 and 5/28. If AMC goes on a similar slide to the March slide, there will be massive returns on these ridiculously cheap put options (9.9% decline today and the sub $10 puts barely moved in price on both the 5/21 and 5/28 expiration dates. Cheap way to place a bet if the squeeze doesnt materialize that could be a &gt;10x return based on how cheap the &lt;$10 puts are for 5/21 and 5/28 put options. If you are holding stock, max gains you are getting for $20 is ~2x but this could be the real money maker with puts sub $10 priced at $0.01-$0.05 that could go to $0.5+ if the stock slides similar to the March slide. If the squeeze materializes then you make all your money there and lose alittle on some cheap put options that could be the real money makers."

0,"I got into the uphill GME battle late, and I'm sure a lot of other apes in here did too. I've had losses in the past couple of weeks. To me, those losses have been worth every penny for how much I've learned. An hour ago I learned that GME was on the reg sho list for almost three months before fully mooning. If I knew the game was that long and that big I wouldn't have even been trying to nickel and dime these daily pumps. If you're also a noob, spend this weekend learning about how gme played out. Do your homework on the stock market in general. I'll be buying as much bbby as I can get my hands on and stop checking the chart all day every day. The longer it takes the more I can horde. Right now there's $1000 in my trading account, my goal is for that number to be 100k by February."
2,"As I continued to notice all my 401k, IRA, and Cryptos lose their value all I wanted to know is where did it all go wrong.

I tried to look at news of what caused this but couldnt find anything worthy of this coincidence. Is this just a market cycle or is there something else Im missing? I know the economy wasnt going to well after JPow let the printer go brrrrrr but it seems odd."

But the underdog traders really work as much as blue collar workers. I mean what, wake up at six am in PST zone, barely sleep cause your head is tired and spinning of numbers and charts.

1,"Gold is a commodity but trades as mining stocks, mutual funds, and etfs. Gold prices tend to rise as the dollar is eroded from inflation.

2,"I dont know shit about stocks really, but theres a lot of red and not a lot of green in that picture. I'm guessing you fucked up big time."
1,"Hello WSB, I've got an interesting proposal for you, with a chance to make some gains with a little lower risk than you may be used to. Aptera motors is a solar electric vehicle company currently in pre-production stages. They need $38M to make it to production, and are selling shares through the SEC regulation A+ for non-public companies. They're setting their valuation at about $700M. EV comanies that make it to production gain a huge amount of value. Rivian has only been producing for 1 year, but it has a market cap of $36B. If this plays out the same, Aptera could pull a 51x after reaching production, or more since their car is more affordable and accessible. The car is why I'm making this post. I want this car, and you do too. Their innovations are in aerodynamics and reduced weight, making a unique car body in the shape of an orca. It looks sick, charges itself in the sun, has an insane 0 to 60, and has a base price of $25,900. This is in the same price range as a prius, but it has 250 miles of range and solar charging at that price. It's also a right to repair company, which is rare for electric cars. Here's where WSB comes in. There are 12.6M WSB members, and Aptera needs $38M to make it to production and start printing cash like Rivian. If .3% of WSB buys $1k, Aptera will be fully funded. Not only will you have a chance at a 51x or more in this nasty bear market, you'll also help make this car a reality. The question is, will you be one of the .3%?"

0,"Rereading through the 8-K I came upon this, ""Licensee acknowledges that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GameStop Corp., a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. To the extent any change of control occurs that results in Licensee no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded U.S. company, Licensee must, upon written request of Immutable, identify itself and its beneficial owners to Immutable and must not hide its identity"" In the 8-K, the ""Licensee"" is GME Entertainment, LLC, not GameStop. So GameStop created and owns a company called GME Entertainment, LLC, and *this* company is in partnership with Immutable X. Now look at this line: ""To the extent any change of control occurs that results in Licensee no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded U.S. company..."" What it is saying is that as of right now, GameStop outright owns GME Entertainment, LLC, and if any change in ownership were to occur, GME Entertainment *must* identify itself and and who owns it, upon the request of Immutable. Why does this matter? There is a secret company, that the general public is not aware of, that is being built for the purposes of providing a marketplace for Web3 gaming assets (NFTs). This company is being funded by GameStop, is not shortable, but yet has the full support of GameStop shareholders. GameStop shareholders acted as Venture Capitalist when GameStop sold $1+ Billion into the open market. Shareholders bought into a startup company. Startups are inherently risky, but their payoff is generally much greater than the capital invested. To be a Venture Capitalist you much have money and generally, be an accredited investor, non of which the average person is. What most of GameStop shareholders might not explicitly be aware of, is that shareholders were given a once in a life time opportunity to be a Venture Capitalist and invest in a new era of gaming, Web3 gaming. It's a risky investment, no doubt, but the potential is there and the right people and partnerships are in/coming into place, in my opinion. It's just a matter of patience for the startup to reach its full potential. Also though, GameStop shareholders *could* (this is speculation) also more directly benefit if GameStop were to spin this company off and issues shares of GME Entertainment to GameStop shareholders. The result of that spin off is up for further speculation, but you get the idea. Right now the NFT marketplace is in Beta, and according to the filing, "" Platform Launch means the bona fide public release of the GameStop web-based NFT trading platform in the U.S. and certain mutually agreed upon non-US regions, which integrates Immutable Xs layer two technology. **Platform Launch shall take place within twelve (12) months**, plus any Extension Periods, of the Effective Date"" Effective Date being 28 January 2022. The ""real"" ""official"" bona fide NFT marketplace, the way in which it was built for (gaming NFTs) should be release within 12 months of January 2022, so about 4 more months. After launch, GME Entertainment has 24 months to hit $1.5 billion in sales in order to achieve milestone 4. Milestone 5 is $3 billion in sales within 24 months from the effective date. From the effective date, GME Entertainment has 2 years to meet all the milestones. Let's focus on the milestone sales of 1.5 billion dollars and turn that into a company valuation. From various websites, the market multiplier for software tech companies ranges from 5x-40x. Using the lower band to keep discussions more reasonable, 1.5 billion dollars in revenue would value the company at 7.5 billion dollars; 3 billion dollars in sales (milestone 5) is 15 billion dollars. So 7.5 - 15 billion dollars baseline. What the market decides is anyone's guess, but there will probably be a lot of speculation in the open market once all of this hits mainstream. If using GameStop shares outstanding, it would put GME Entertainment stock price at $50/share. So add $50 to whatever the current stock price of GameStop for simplicity. Now of course there are assumptions and speculations here, but considering that GME Entertainment is a startup, assumptions and speculations are required."

1,"So much negative info has been said of SAVA. They have been accused of fraud. They have been accused of doctoring results. Lawsuits have been filed, petitions to the FDA, articles written, and so on and so on.all by people shorting the stock. This isnt mo own conspiracy ideas either. The people shorting the stocks have admitted to hiring the lawyers and getting the petitions filed to stop the phase three trials. They have all failed. The journals such as neuroscience have said they they found no evidence of data manipulation or fraud. Today, the SEC closed its case. Its on twitter so you can look it up. Id link to it but Id prefer to eat the red crayons as well before climbing into that burning pile of trash. So, here is whats important. SAVA is in phase 3 and it is going very well so far. This could be the first real Alzheimers drug that works. It could be used for people with Mild Cognitive Impairment which is a precursor to Alzheimers. The amount of people being diagnosed with Alzheimers is growing and they drug is going to be one of the most valuable available. Treatment will likely be $50-100k per person a year with a drug like this. Here is the thing.there are only 40M shares. Almost 25% held by institutions. Over 25% sold short which is an increase over last month. The Short interest ratio is 4.80 days. This is a real stock with a real drug that can change lives and still 25% short.

CPI includes energy and food, rising energy and food is often transitory and difficult to control with monetary policy. So they look at Core which excludes energy and food. It is ALL they care about really. They have said they want it at 2 in the past, but a couple of years ago they said 3 would be ""OK"", and now they say 2.5, but they would take 4. It's at 6.3 and it rose .4 from last month. No one is losing their mind about CPI going up .1, no one! Well... consumers, but that is the same as no one to Wall Street. I actually thought with the supply pressure index peaking last December and core starting to come down since March, along with the Fed tightening, they would pause soon, being already near neutral. While I knew they would hit us for .75 in September anyway, I thought they might only hit us for .50 in November, and then hold a while from there, ""if"" core was easing down this month and next.

1,"I am making this post to let everyone know my thoughts regarding the way that GME, AMC, and BBBY are positioned for tomorrow headed into Quad witching day. - Review of the Day Compared to the broad market, all three stocks did very well. Individually, on the [daily chart](https://imgur.com/a/cRiMExm), GME is remaining immediately below it's volume shelf, AMC is actually just above it's volume shelf, and BBBY is struggling the most with multiple immediate deep volume shelves above it. What this means is that AMC is positioned the best (on the daily time frame), GME is positioned very well (especially considering the impressive manner with which it closed the day; see the volume candle at the bottom of the screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/0jCI)),and BBBY is not far behind (considering it's rally into the close, as well; see the volume candle at the bottom of the screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/Xle2Xoa)). Outside of this, as of yesterday, the skew for all of these tickers was indicating that they would likely face bearish sentiment (more positive value actually indicates more bearish sentiment). However, as of today, they are all [skewed](https://imgur.com/a/pWIgmS0)in favor of bullish sentiment. For those of you scratching your heads saying ""what does skew mean?"" It is a measure of the total implied volatility to both the upside and to the downside. So, if the total implied volatility tells you that a stock is likely to move wildly in a general direction, the skew tells you which direction that wild swing is likely to move toward. - What does all of this mean!? Ultimately, I suspect that the broad market is likely to remain flat or even perhaps ralley tomorrow given that it is Quad witching day, the [SPY](https://imgur.com/a/devHb64) rallied into the close, and that the price action naturally gravitates toward the point of control (POC; red line flowing from the strongest volume shelf). I suspect that this will serve to propel our beloved Meme Stocks toward Valhalla... All we have to do is break away from our own volume shelves, and then, they are gone! Let me know if anyone has any questions. I'm happy to help. I am learning alongside you and so, I appreciate you making me think critically. I welcome negative criticism. :) Tl;Dr - Tomorrow's OPEX looks great for our Meme Stocks. The broad market is likely to remain flat or ralley tomorrow, thereby helping our movement."

Delaware Chancery Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick ruled Thursday that the billionaire can amend his counterclaims to Twitters lawsuit against him with the payment to Peiter Zatko.

Do you think this is enough to prove (TWTR) has something to hide in regard to the bot count?"
1,"Dont take my word for it, Im just an ape with a green crayon drawing portraits on the moon.VAXART ticker VXRT (formerly Aviragen Therapeutics) is a south San Francisco biotech that has seen an increase in institutional buying over the past year. As of this month, piper Sandler and Jeffries both initiated a buy rating with a $13 and $18 price target.The stock currently trades at $7.50. With a low float of only 122million shares and 38% institutional ownership, it wont take much positive news for this piece of Art to be worth more than a DaVinci.Phase 2 trials are expected soon regarding their covid vaccine in pill form. Should the results be positive, expect this small biotech to put on a green laser lightshow and bust a nut on your RH screen.The company is also working on a Norovirus pill and have enrolled their first patient in clinical trials last month. Currently there are zero Norovirus vaccines or antivirals available. Do you know how lucrative this could be? Cruise ships have Norovirus outbreaks all the time! This could easily bring in 1 billion per year.With a market cap just under 1 billion, this biotech has room to run. Given Leonardo DaVincis Salvatore Mundi fetched 450million at Auction, this piece of vaxART is already worth more!"

You could also select multiple options. That was yesterday. Today, you can no longer filter sheet sets by these criteria unless you type it in the search filter. And you cannot enter multiple search terms to filter by. So if you're looking for a king size sheet set made from cotton or bamboo, with 300-500 thread count, good luck. For a store that is primarily known for selling bed and bath related items, why would they remove these filters? If the filters don't return, I think it'll mean bad things and beyond.

1,"Both AMC &amp; GME both have several large investors with a lot more bananas than we could ever imagine period. IMHO I dont think that they can manipulate quite as much as we think, only because the other big apes would file and call them out almost immediately, I would assume.

I was excited, I was anxious, I wasnt sleeping (yes i got some, obviously) for probably a solid 6 weeks. Now Im bored with it and the hype is over for me, I barely check anything and think of it as just a long term hold or a lot better savings account. So now these assholes are thinking well sell and get bored, but when I get bored, I forget I even have the stock and I dont need the money I put in either, so now theyre fucked and not getting any of my bananas until this rocket actually takes off.

(Graham was Warren Buffetts mentor.) And this book mentions Cramer by name right in the introduction. I quote: February 2000, hedge-fund manager James J. Cramer proclaimed that Internet-related companies ""are the only ones worth owning right now."" These ""winners of the new world,"" as he called them, ""are the only ones that are going higher consistently in good days and bad."" Cramer even took a potshot at Graham: ""You have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that existed before the Web. If we used any of what Graham and Dodd teach us, we wouldnt have a dime under management."" 7All these so-called experts ignored Grahams sober words of warning: ""Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors."""

2,"Let me preface this report with a little bit of back story. I have been considered an elite level Wendy's employee for over 5 years counting now. I am not supposed to share this information but my company is using the media hype regarding inflation as an excuse to raise our prices despite there being an obvious reason no one is talking about. Although my drive through register has only been considered elite for the past 5 years I have over 20 years experience operating under the radar. Since the pandemic started there's been a clear and obvious reason inflation has been running rampant in the fast food industry... You highly regarded mother fuckers are asking for way too much free sauce. It's gotten to the point where the fast food industry has asked for assistance on the hush hush. I did the math and my driver through alone lost $1,600,000 in free sauce given out, multiply that by all the fast food joints in the world and it becomes clear why inflation remains so high. Every industry is helping cover for greedy fucks asking for more free sauce. So next time you go to the Wendy's drive through go easy on the sauce you fat highly regarded member of the community."

1,CANOO chart has a very aggressive bullish formation. I think it is matter of few days to approach the price of $5. More specifically: 1. it has a flag pattern that the beginning of the formation was followed by very high volumes (over 380 million shares in 3 days in row).2. the bullish breakout from this formation I feel will be on the same if not higher volumes considering that over 5 euros many who are short will start to feel extremely uncomfortable.3. the flag pattern has been formed after it created a large rising gap first. *Processing video ynqbf6vyaai91...*
0,"I don't care what BBBY does to remain solvent and close to profitability, if they need to close 75% of their stores and get their employees down to 100 people, then do it. What's more important is the live grenade that is the stock price. Our system has become so financialized, companies and executives using stock valuations as collateral to finance their lives, fundamentals no longer matter. We saw what happened with HKTD. Cramer wasn't whining about their profitability, was he? BBBY is about whether or not we can keep pushing the share price up and bleed the shorts out just like Tesla did. Brick by brick. I don't think Cohen is a dummy. GME/BBBY really aren't about the products/services, they're just about keeping the company and share price alive and as high as possible. We saw what happened with those zombie stocks that were all but dead, trading at .00001. All of a sudden, a 10,000% gain one day. Cohen and his big money backers found the short meme basket, started turning those companies around and came up with a plan to squeeze the shorts' nuts. At least, that's what I'd do. I think DRS is the smart decision. Options are too fickle and can be slammed out of the money, handing millions over to the MMs. We need to do something consistent. Your thoughts?"

1,"While meme stocks are often associated with risky investments, there are a few with strong fundamentals that investors might want to buy to cash in on the craze. Nokia (NOK): Nokia has transformed dramatically, re-emerging as a major player in the telecom industry. When looking for the best meme stocks to buy, it is important to shield yourself against volatility. The best way to do so is through investing in meme stocks with strong fundamentals. For example, you want to look for stocks with a history of growing earnings, a strong balance sheet and a proven business model. Additionally, consider buying stocks that trade at low valuations to protect yourself against this inherent volatility. For many investors, meme stocks and solid fundamentals do not go hand in hand. Companies such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) are best known for being volatile, and investors often feel they cant be relied on to provide stability. While there is no guarantee that any particular meme stock will be successful, investors should carefully research any stock before buying it. Not only do these three companies have strong business models, but they are also operating in high-growth industries. This fundamental strength gives them a distinct advantage over other companies that do not have such a safety net. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) was once the undisputed king of the mobile phone market. However, its dominance began to unravel in 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone. It was slow to embrace touch screens and failed to capitalize on the popularity of app stores. As a result, its once-loyal customer base began to desert Nokia in droves. The company desperately attempted to regain market share by adopting Microsofts (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system, but it was too late. By 2013, Nokias phones were no longer selling in significant numbers, and the company was forced to sell its handset business to Microsoft. However, Nokia has been focusing on 5G for the last five years, and it looks to be in a prime position to continue succeeding in this new area. The company has been investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) for 5G technology, and its products have been well-received by customers. Nokia is also one of the few companies with a complete end-to-end 5G solution, which gives it a significant advantage over its competitors. Nokia has stitched together seven consecutive earning beats, demonstrating the companys superior fundamentals. It is also a well-rounded company with a diversified product portfolio and a strong presence in emerging and developed markets. Furthermore, Nokia has a strong balance sheet with plenty of dry powder to invest in growth initiatives. In sum, Nokia is a high-quality company with a bright future, which is why Nokia is among the best meme stocks to buy."

1,"My fellow autists, Once again the world has sought to divide us. Yesterday it was with silver and short ladder attacks. Last week, with brokerages. Before that, politics, race, Android and Apple, football and football, smooth brain and smoother brain. This narrative has dragged on for as long as I can remember. The hedge fund managers and corporate backers and media pundits who've pushed us towards failure for decades are the same who seek our failure today. To them, we're no different than the commodities and securities they so freely and fragrantly manipulate. At our expense they use our diamond hands, gorilla strength, and full tilt retardation against us, and the truth is that until now we've drooled idly by and let it happen. We let them overshort us to the brink of moral bankruptcy, economic collapse, and cultural disaster, while they sat back and stuffed their pockets with our tendies. Until $GME. We, in all of our smooth brained glory, came together in the name of a hopeless cause because we believed we had the power to change it for the better. We set aside our differences and agreed that despite them, we found something worth fighting for. Today we stood shoulder to shoulder with the great apes of old. We fervently beat our chests with diamond hands and shouted ""HOLD"" as we stared down our oppressors. Some paper hands fled in the face of this tyranny, but we HELD! In glorious revolution we lit our forges and fired that paper into endless diamonds. Now, on the frontline of yet another bloody battlefield, we find ourselves strapped onto the backs of rockets. Ready to launch ourselves into the heavens if only to add more stars to the night sky for those below us. We do not fear death, for what's $323 worth when priced against the soul of our people? Take in the enemies terror. Look them in the eyes as we take to the stars my friends, for they'll speak of us generations from now. Apes bring hope. Diamond hands no drive good, rockets only go up. We go too? Make no mistake, we are here fighting for so much more than $GME, but it is absolutely $GME that we're fighting for. Believe in us. Believe in yourself. Believe in a better world for all smooth brains where the bulls**t the elites pull on us and call ""protection"" is brought to the dirt and burned off in the glow of our afterburners. With hands like diamonds we sail into the tides of eternity,Monkeys amongst the stars. WE LIKE THE STOCK."

There are people in my life that I cannot convince to invest in GME. Does that mean I want them to suffer? Absolutely not. What the fuck is wrong with people. The only people I want to suffer are the hedgefunds, not normal people. Although my portfolio is 100% GME across 3 brokers, I can't convince my family members. I can't blame them, as they're from an older generation and do not really understand what is going on. Despite this, I do not want to see people close to me suffer as a result of hedgies completely fucking over the market to cover their positions. They're mainly invested in things like Tesla, NVidia, SPY and other boomer-type stocks. I don't know much other than GME and told them maybe water ($AWK) would be a good idea. They think gold/silver.

The media will do its best to do what it has always done, serve the elite but even they will not be able to contain the storm they have been feeding silently. I say this for many reasons but one of them primarily being the amount of high end real estate that has started to hit the market at really really low prices. Most of them seeking a cash buyout. Desperation is at an all time high. Expensive toys have started to flood the market at yet again rock bottom prices. All looking for a quick cash buy out. The demand you are seeing for high end items is inflated. For instance if a high end car company only promises to (without making it public) produce say 10 high end cars for FY 2023 then it can say that its entire stock is sold out. There are other variables that are slowly showing up if you know where to look. Good luck!"

2,What ever happened to the $BODY rush? My poor stock sank faster than an elephant on the Titanic. Am I the only one left on this ship?
2,"Since when the has the stock market or WSB ever been about telling people what they should or should not do. WE DO NOT GIVE FINANCIAL ADVICE I get it, blah blah blah, something something something annoying. But why the actual hell are you guys actively spreading FUD against them? Dont tell them to sell Just buy puts and shut up"
1,Probably will be. Figure we will hear about how there is a chance of 100bps increasing to 50% after tomorrow
0,"Guys im thinking of getting into the share market and i thought which place can be the best place for it ,other than wallstreetbets, the most retarded stock related reddit. So any advice? And things that i should look out for ?"
0,"Am I crazy to think that perhaps we are heading into a collapse similar to 2008, but this time build on student debt and credit card debt maybe topped off by some housing debt? Also that Bidens student debt forgiveness is just the first cash injection into the banks to support the asset backed securities that the student loans are tied into? Once mortgages became well regulated again the cash machine was closed. Until someone realized that student debt is unforgivable and can also have insane variable rates, + most 18 year old kids are highly regarded and will sign anything you put in front of them. So then there was a large push for everyone to get college degrees, loans for everyone who wanted to go to school. But the real point is that our entire economy is built on debt, so as long as workin schmos are in debt and payin then everythings good But when times are bad and the consumer debt defaults get too high the whole system quakes"
1,"Monday Morning on Earnings, Autozone(NYSE:AZO) will announce it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Carvana, a leading web-first online used car dealer in the United States and is known for its multi-story car vending machines, for approximately $18 billion in cash and stock.

0,Can anyone on this page please explain to all the smooth brained apes why multiple sources have contradicting results for what BBBYs short interest float is? Is it 40% or is it 108%? Why do these sources say one versus the other?[Float Checker](https://www.floatchecker.com/stock?float=BBBY)
2,"Even with inflation and interest rates, markets starting to look oversold."
0,Wave 5 SPY to 340
1,"Full disclosure I own this stock already at a average cost of $7.50 but as I have followed this stock for awhile it has quickly become my favorite stock in my portfolio. There are several key dates in April that present opportunities for massive gains, I urge all of you to go and do your own DD on this stock as I don't want to give you any of my own bias. But keep an eye on it mid to late April in the top gainers column. I will be going all in on the next red day; see you all in May!"
1,"I am currently writing this as Im delivering a package and pissing in a Gatorade bottle. With FOMC meetings this week, I assure you it wont be good. Apparently JP has ran out of ink and theres no more money to be printed. If Amazon hits 96.69 by end of week. I will take the Gatorade bottle of piss and have a nice sip and quit my job. Cheers, aR."

2,"This stock was over 10 dollars a couple of months ago and now it is at like 6 dollars per share.I don't get it. Polestar has met all of their production goals, they have huge deals with rental car companies like Hertz where they sold 65 thousand Polestar 2s.There are even Polestar 2 cop cars in the UK as well as taxis. On top of that the Polestar 2 has been well received by automotive journalists and consumers.Additionally they are set to reveal the Polestar 3 SUV next month which will be manufactured exclusively in South Carolina. So how is it that this stock is such a fail basket? I am holding 801 shares at 6.76 average and of this stock doesn't at least let me break even then how am I going to explain the losses to the wife's boyfriend?"
2,"What happened to all the short interest on $ROOT ? This stock was tapped to have short interest potential by multiple posters daily discussions. Now its all gone quiet. Ive never been a WSB conspiracy theorist that the hedges are trying to get us to pump and dump, but theres definitely some people who are trying to manipulate the community. Yes I know hold gainz dont come in one day. Just was curious if the short interest had really dried up or if the squeeze had been squooze."
0,So if we look at 2008 vs today - we're 1000 points from the bottom. Analysis below - that is all. https://preview.redd.it/rrpla96o4pn91.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f074ab4b95c225fa2868fb74dbada69b51e3b932
2,SPY stopped barely shy of the bullish marker. VIX dropped barely below 24. I have no clue what to do. Probably dumping my bets until I figure it out.
1,"Can we start making sundial trend for a friend who is totally not me. He has tons of calls at 2.00 for end of April, would really like a pump assist. Marriages may be on the line here people"
2,"Are people still using Robinhood? Im still pissed they turned off the buy Button during the GME frenzy to the benefit of their real customers, hint: not you! (the firms that paid Robinhood for Order Flow are the real customer. You are the product thats being used). Sure other companies pay for order flow, but theres something egregious about Robinhoods approach, marketing, trustworthiness, etc."
0,Source: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20210616.htm The estimates for real GDP growth &amp; Fed funds rate are also pretty interesting
0,"If it is bullish to sell puts, why would you short a stock with a P/C ratio of &lt; 1 ???? Wouldn't that just mean that more people are bullish on the stock, and henceforth, selling puts to smooth brained apes??? &amp;#x200B; this is not financial advice guh"
2,Shorts are closing. We dropped 12% in 3 weeks
1,"Am I the man? Well I'll let you figure that one out, arriving at the airport - destination? Ibiza - weapon of choice? Ryan air. ""Come right in sir, here is your seat"", Middle seat? Yes with no one next to me on either left or right. It's just like that when you're the man sometimes. Oh i better check on my 380 SPY puts expiring Wednesday I thought. Open up my brokerage account, lied about 10+ years of options knowledge. Idiots, I was born for this. Bing bing bing, jackpot - puts up 100% quick sell 2 minutes before the flight attendants ask us to turn our phones off. She wants me. Easy $900, heh and bulls laughed yesterday.. pathetic"
2,And you can buy a ps5 in 1000 different stores that arent GME. The last year of ps5 sales hasnt done shit to help GME from blowing through money.
2,"I am losing my shit and I will probably start breaking stuff, every time I try to buy the dips it goes down even more WHAT THE FUCKKK!!!!"
1,"Im not very savvy on cryptos but a friend of mine invested a couple hundred bucks a month ago and shes got roughly 25k now, so Im investing some too. This is my first post but just thought Id let people know about it"
0,Lets pretend I am a regard for a second. I have about 50k invested in dividend stonks and about 5k cash. Ive been trying to hedge against losses with sqqq but somehow even in this market I manage to paper hands losses. What would be a good medium term play in terms of a spy put expiring end of year. Like what number would you shoot for. Puts make 0 sense to me. Can you lose money if the stock price continues to fall even way below your put? Like if I had a spy put for 360 and it fell to 350 would my put lose money?
1,BBBY isnt going bankrupt plus holiday season is coming up soon. What do you have to lose $8 a share is a good price. It might squeeze or it might not to be honest. But I still believe and Im hodling!!
2,"Wtf happened to this shit? 7k of gains evaporated so far today, /u/martinshkreli any idea whats going on?"
2,Jet Blue is at $6 and some change. 5-YEAR LOW. IMO Huge long term potential to 3x your capital. But i dont know crap. I could lose it all if they file for bankruptcy. Can someone give their 2 on the risk $JBLU holds. And if you also currently hold any positions Thanks in advance

2,"I posted this morning and some mod deleted it. I'm not breaking any rules so if you're mad you didn't see this in the morning blame whatever mod deleted me. Rumble Video will be trading on the Nasdaq as a freshly merged symbol **RUM** on Monday. The valuation is 2.5 Billion atm which is ridiculous. It's been stuck in the SPAC phase so it's always had a floor of $10 and couldn't go lower. For most of the time after the initial business announcement a year ago it's been pretty much right at $10 flat. It could never fall below $10 cause SPAC. During the run-up people bid it up 40% so I went super short. However, when Monday comes it can finally fall below $10 which it will. Honestly at $5 (1 Billion valuation) is still too high but that's when I will cover my positions. I honestly think most people in this forget that this stock can actually fall below $10 when it starts trading on the Nasdaq as RUM on Monday. Positions: 35k in shorts / put options: [https://i.imgur.com/FspFLYd.png](https://i.imgur.com/FspFLYd.png)"
2,Werent you waiting for the rest of the market to crash? Because GameStop had negative beta? And that would be the catalyst for the squeeze? Well the market has crashed. Werent you waiting for Cohen to announce some sort of groundbreaking marketplace? And that would be the catalyst for the squeeze? Well he did announce it. Werent you waiting for the big bad hedgies to fold? And that would be the catalyst for the squeeze? Well Melvin did fold. A lot of us made money before this market crash. Unfortunately you did not. I tried to warn you. See my post history. Fucking idiots lol.
1,"When Gamecock first took off everyone was posting about it in the 20s,40s,60s and so on. You all think this is over? Nah we still a lot more to go up or down with our sweet new bbby. Yall are scared to see your portfolio go down 20%? Dont be a paper handed bitch you should have known after a 30% back to back gain was going to cause it to fall atleast some. Fuck you bears its hunting season pussy. You know the true indicator and thats inverse all the coke rats."
1,"Not sure who is following along, but $LTRPB is up 150% and climbing today. Average volume on this stock is incredibly low so the price is already flying with volume only at 99k on the day. Trading keeps being halted because it doesn't take much for this thing to moon. Hop on now before this little trip advisor vacation is over!"
1,"People buy now don't loose the chance to buy cheap, the best and unique company who provide full quantum services + technologies, BUY now soon will see 200$"
2,S&amp;P 500 for example: They only made moves at market open and let price consolidate after that. I havent been able to trade since June 10. Everything is low quality. How do they still have a job after this
1,"What's the funniest thing about Intel and AMD competition ? Intel has a stagnating year revenue of 70B of dollars while having a lower market capitalisation than a company with a soon stagnating year revenue of 30B of dollars : AMD. INTC stock is currently sitting at a 2016 low price level with a 23% increase in revenue since. Intel recent losses and AMD recent wins have led to people believing that Intel could lose its chip monopoly, spoiler alert : it's not happening. If there's any dip you wanna buy to recover from your BBBY losses, it's this one. Current stock price : 31,22 Selling price : 55"
1,Lets buy regal. Its about to go into chapter 7 bankruptcy. Buy it enough and itll bounce back just like AMC did

0,Have you seen Russel play this year? lol
1,Currently WAY undervalued! I use the product myself and there is no near product that can compete Alteryx! Data aggregation and manipulation is becoming a HUGE part of business decision! expect fortune 500 companies investing HEAVILY in data for the next decade!
1,"Currently sitting on 80 $1 calls expiring in November and 1,000 shares of $SDC. This is not financial advice but figured I would bless some of my fellow degens before the money starts pumping."
2,With the fall of BBBY GME as well as MEME STOCK. Can it still climb again? I don't think institutions and capital are willing to provide another opportunity in the short term.
2,"You were supposed to buy the PUTS 4 weeks ago. Now you're too late, everyone is getting on the PUT bandwagon, so SPY guaranteed for at least a few days."
1,"The deal with $CSSE is happening, and it's all based on share price. So the higher CSSE goes, the more value for RDBX. By comparison, $CSSE is way undervalued at $7/share. Had a high in the 50's."
1,META too juicy at this price. Bought 1/2024 $160 calls just before close
0,"What do you think will happen with these trades? The screenshot is the time and sales data for AAPL 9/16 150 calls, AAPL ended 9/16 at $150.7, meaning this option expired worthless, but why would anyone be on the buy side of these large orders seconds before the trading session ended? These add up to well over millions of premiums. The buy sides of these orders were almost 100% sure gonna lose it all. Why did they buy? https://preview.redd.it/8gr05sr6hbo91.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=189dc626cafbc95fda1a11efae29b9ee04e261b2"

1,just general volatility but likely with a bullish bias at least todY
2,"NVDA has reached the same technical level, on a weekly basis, than it tested on 2019, the previous downcycle. I'm betting this will continue trending lower together with the market.. as this time semiconductors are not only facing a typical downcycle, but real recession fears (China deceleration, EU energy squeeze, US recession). Believe that, for now, peak inflation talks have allowed it to resist a bit longer. Any views on this? &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/ugfuuq0bk8o91.png?width=1203&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c3e38788c224fe9068ee8a2cbab2d1c40bbf94d"

0,"This big club has been getting away with manipulating markets for way too long. Just look at the JPM silver scam. It's all just swept away and forgotten, well except for Bernie. Anybody have that mem hanging around with the nooses hanging from a Wall St. lamp post?"
1,"thats only if youre looking to exercise the option if you paid $5 for an $80 strike call when the stock was at $79, if it hits $80 you can turn around and sell it for $5.50 for example because theres likely buyers who thinks the stock will go higher than $85 and therefore are willing to pay more for the $80 call"
1,i think im just going to buy rivian and hope it becomes like tesla
1,"VIX above 30, game over."

1,Institutional investors are slowly buying these stocks when German legalization is around the corner. Retailers should accumulate this before it is too expensive. Trade range $17-25 after German legalization.
1,"I bought 1 share of BBBY at $14.70 today, I am wondering if this thing could grow more, If I buy $500 tomorrow at $16 a share do you think its a smart choice? could this thing hit 20?"
2,"So today I bought some gme at 24.95 per share, just 20 shares nothing crazy i know, but as soon as the trade gets filled it says im down $83 dollars, and it says my average cost is 29 dollars, i have no idea how this is possible if i bought all my shares at 24.95, please help"

0,Over here buying YZYGAP is like eating HOT SUSHI out of a large trash bin . After YE dropped his contract with Gap it like buying a foreign object. Who knows whats next with YE.
1,"So $WEN is a good buy on two fronts: 1. They just had a great financial quarter. With that, they increased their dividend rate just a few weeks ago. They held great during the pandemic and now things are opening back up. They also added tendies to the menu. 2. They meme. Their Twitter has a reputation for meming. And we meme. Wendys has always been a staple here for memes. Their Twitter is already getting @'s for being up 15%-20% today. This can have a compounding effect. It's a match made in heaven. Wendys is tendies."
1,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is set to give its latest quarterly earnings report [today after close](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/ulta). Analysts estimate that Ulta Beauty will report an earnings per share (EPS) of $5.00. Ulta Beauty bulls will hope to hear the company to announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. We should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast). Shares of Ulta Beauty were trading at $401.31 as of August 23. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 5.12%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are likely bullish going into this earnings release. Last quarter the company beat EPS by $1.84, which was followed by a 12.47% increase in the share price the next day. They posted 54% earnings growth, with sales rising 21%. Analysts expect earnings-per-share growth of 9% for the quarter, and 13% growth for the full year. This ones an easy with with calls. That's why I'm picking up 8/26 440c @ 4.10/share."
1,Haven't checked here in a while. Anything brewing with Novavax (NVAX)? That looks like it has the potential to be a GameStop and AMC.
1,"No direct news, but iGaming growth and news across GNOG expansion and Canada is giving PSFE a good reputation."
2,I get it was a split or dividend or whatever from AMC but its just one more stock in the portfolio to worry about and I cant tell what the fuck gives it any value? Any reason not to sell it?

1,"Hello my fellow apes!! This is not investment advice and a little hot sauce goes a long way with a emerald sea crayon. Seems we are in the midst of some heavy duty psychological warfare, deception and flat out lies.....CNBC.... AMC Entertainment to seek investor approval for 500 million shares sale, CEO tells CNBC...... Facts..... AMC is voting for the option to issue shares in the future, not right now. What would be the benefit of AMC getting a positive vote for this item and actually issuing 500 million shares? Thats simple, CASH!!! But whats the downside? This is ultimately the question you have to ask. Who here is saving AMC?? Whos going to the movies and buying snacks and drinks?? Ill tell you who...... A BUNCH OF FUCKING APES Thats who!!!! So what happens if we get fucked over by the CEO of AMC? He wont need to worry about the fucking hedge funds.... we will put his ass out of business in a heartbeat!! We have the power!!! That being said, thats not whats happening because the CEO knows if social media and a bunch of retards can save him, we can definitely destroy him. Lets see if this vote doesnt shake out the phantom shorts and get this rocket ship off the ground. Why is the price down today? Can you say fuck, the market is closed for three days? Thats a lot of time for paper hands to have doubt and lose confidence. Trust the fucking process."
2,"Don't be fooled they are spreading misinformation to try and fold as many hands as possible. There is no way out for them except major losses or prison... some are deciding this weekend which choice they will make. Id like to see someone do some real TA and analysis on the actual value of GME with all of this free marketing, support etc. Tech companies are often huge valuation with no product and the cronies seem to have no issue with that..."

0,"$ZEST (Ecoark) For those looking into this companies situation, you know this is a good situation for investors &amp; Ecoark. I just can't seem to figure out why this isn't being talked about as much. DD:-Walmart &amp; Ecoark had a contract which allowed Walmart to use the ZEST technology and work with Ecoark in order to help Walmart's supply chain in the produce world. It allowed Walmart to save billions on wasted food that went bad too quickly. A couple of years ago, Walmart terminated the contract and made their own program (with the help of IBM) called Eden, which did the exact same thing.-Walmart got caught with their hand in the cookie jar and Ecoark is suing them.- Every instance of Walmart in court is to either wait their opponents out until they cannot pay for the long court cases, or buy out the company/ its product so they can continue to make money on it.-You can check the court documents on Pacer with Judge Moody presiding over the case.- Yahoo there are a bunch of bashers, but there is one person whom has done a workup of those owning shares and how much they would be worth, he goes by ""Zest vs Walmart Jury trial 3/29"" and has been very thorough throughout the entire process and ignores a lot of the bashers which are paid to downplay certain stocks.-It was recently a penny stock but the company did a reverse split to bring it onto the nasdaq.-court case started today and a jury was chosen upon, ecoark wants to see this through to the end, and with messages coming from the head of the company at the time, there isnt much that Walmart can do to say they didnt steal a product under contract. Please do your DD, I put the details to get someone interested in helping their financial future, but there is so much info on this that can be found by a simple search."

2,"Weve all been seeing the lost posts and the I dONt UnDeRStAnD BBBY posts all weekend. Bad news for hedgies because we remember all these tricks from GME. Shorts only have one trick, to keep going short regardless of price movement. The price of BBBY will only become more volatile over the next week in an attempt to shake paper hands. But if you can long hodl youll see the largest gains. GMEs trading above $100 pre-split value and Im still hodling. BBBY is going to be worth more than $100 too Im guessing. Time to and make some generational wealth. Youll be able to tell your grandkids about this one."

1,"Guys I was looking at the charts and thought of this its gonna go up on Monday, I know what u may think why, but because through my analysis as a noob trader it just is going to because I heard of the FOMC, and because it will be crazy high until we hear from the FOMC which then it will dump and we will be a happy time."

I just find it cool to see how stock trading can help eliminate the burden of college loans / debt. College is a wonderful experience to learn and develop, but not when people are left with decades of debt. The system needs to change but I'm glad students are investing to break this trend.

1,"So we all heard about Citidal and the 600m loan that they took to deal with the 'volatility' situation they are in it.For me we got them real hard, They use that money to x2 and x4 thire positions, probbly by doing some more shady things such as ghost shares and trading in the black pull.We won this fight to many time, it cost them bilions over and over again..Now, when they are deeply invested in BBBy, this is just a matter of time and a test for our will.Is just that simple, We keep doing what we did (that works) Buy&amp;HoldFOR THE NOOBIES:Buy only with money that you can efford to Hold!Do not go all in!I saw here some posts with over 50k likes.If every like here has around 300s avg* (some has 2000 and some 50), Only with that we could cuse a real damage (squeez) to somone who took a loan to win us and short with no logic.

Where you once had 1 you now have 4. **Stock Dividend:** The Gamestop board ***mints 3 new shares for each 1 actually existing share then sends them to the DTCC for them to be distributed to shareholders.*** You're all big boys and girls, you can figure out why this distinction is important.

Most importantly, it seems like it's not only betting on individual stocks, but betting on individual stocks at certain prices against a generally more well-informed party.

I read about the APE shares a while back and thought it seemed like some Wall St BS as a way to take the eye off the ball and add confusion to the pot.

APE is not holding up as strong as AMC. I would imagine folks are selling off APE? Im inclined to. How does this help the hedgies skirt the squeeze? The shorts are only on the AMC stock not the APE.

Downside: the price of cookies will probably go up astronomically. Positions: GME"

An Update for those:eToro - is looking good but I dont think they have AMCTrading212 - Yes as well but be cautious as they froze earlier UPDATE2: Freetrade is allowing orders again.I will say I feel it is a useless gesture as they made the announcement to stop at the start of the trading day and then made the announcement we could buy again at the end.

These sensors can prevent oil spills/leaks as well as prevent flooding. A company like this has real value, which is why hedge funds are shorting this stock.

1,A big selloff happened last week because everyone was fearful of core cpi and expecting a bigger than thought rate hike from the fed but it wont happen since jpow will stick to his plan of a soft landing. Last time in june when 50 bps were promised but the cpi data was so bad the fed decided to do a 75 rate hike they warned wall street before and a big selloff began before the decision was announced. It was done because they didnt want to shock the market following their decision. Nothing like that happened in the last days and the whole market is behaving like the whole economy will collapse. Dont be scared of all this and buy calls
1,"First if all, I'm not a financial advisor so don't take this thread as only due diligence. Why it will rise:- bankruptcy is off the table- stabilised an enormous loan- even after a month, people are still posting about BBBY and will het mainstream at some point- people who are still holding are mostly . When the stock hits 9$ and/or 10$, FOMO will start again- more shorters than ever before Why it might not rise- stock crashed in the last week's and thus some people will be scared to buy and don't want to burn their hands- it's currently off Regsho- General Media is still on the other side of the story Please add your own reasons why it will go to the moon or crash."

Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. The burdens of high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them. As states in the past We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored. We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done. *Because of this, I ask you now to all bend over and take 75BPS as expected in your anus. You had been warned, I told you in our last meeting an unusual high rate hike is due* Markerts will rejoice...

0,"I've been looking at the rise, fall, and possible re-rise of BBBY intensely over the past month or so. One of the things that really struck me was how people claimed this Freeman fellow didn't really exist. Izabella Kaminska just interviewed him for her new publication The Blind Spot, which I follow closely on Twitter. One of the things that struck me from this interview was that Freeman seems to understand why such paranoia is widespread online - just as Izabella does. The rise of deepfakes, AI images, and fake online profiles is creating a sense of detachment from reality that has infected the online and offline realms. Do you think it's justified to question someones existence in today's day and age? Considering the context of fakery online, my answer isn't a simple no.

1,"Alright gang, time to pump this extremely shorted stock. You don't need a 20% downpayment to get out of mom's basement. Long Call Options are cheaper. And a stock is the same price than a Wendy's Biggie Meal. Financials: Current Market Cap is $700M. RDFN reported $590M in Cash alone at the end of 2021. Not including inventory owned and any other assets. Also most of their liabilities are in Convertible Senior Notes issued for 2025 and 2027. Totaling $1.2B. Effective interest rate on these? both at .42% and .9% issued in 2020 and 2021 respectively. RDFN King of Free Money Tendies. Sooner or later the crows come home to roost and these investors will want their money in the form of cash or shares. To combat this potential share dilution RDFN themselves engaged in 2027 capped calls valued at $93/share. They paid $62M for these calls. Either they are degenerate yolo bagholders right now or they truly believe they will be at $90/share at 2027. If my choices are pay for a house in cash by 2027, or remain homeless until then, i'd choose the former. Guidance/Outlook: Real Estate transactions slowing down is a risk with rising interest rates, but in actuality RDFN's US market share by value is only 1.17% of the total real estate market. Definitely a lot more room to grow. With the new generation of buyers being more well versed in the digital world, the need for realtors is becoming obsolete. Not to mention RDFN's rental services is booming. Revenue was $0 in 2020, but $121M in 2021. That's 6.3% of their total revenue. Their Gross Profit for rentals was $100M while Brokerage services was $300M. Redfin is sneakily turning into a rental company than just a mere brokerage service. They did not shutter their home buying services like Zillow did. And their profit shows that they have a better understanding of the real estate market than their ibuying competitors like the O's that can't be named, and Z. Downsides: One thing I would like RDFN to get rid of is in their Mortgage servicing arm. No point in trying to be a bank. Especially with interest rates fluctuating. It's losing them money each year. TLDR: If currently living in basement, Skip the $5 Biggie Meal, Buy $RDFN instead. Move out sometime 2025-2027. Not financial advice."

It's not about fundamentals; it's about the SQUEEZE. BBBY has the potential. Let's talk CRAZY talk, 10 shares at $300 would be $3,000 or even at 80 would be $800 for a $110 dollar bet. Christmas money. And make no mistake, it is a BET you are making. The Dow Jones dropped over a 1000 points yesterday while BBBY was up nearly 6% on no real news. Sure they announced a date about the conference call which, lets be honest, doesn't mean much. BBBY has the potential to squeeze. That's it. It's that simple. Be apart of it or not. But if BBBY does take off and it goes FULL MOON, then brotha, it could be glorious (just like Blue). I'm in for much more (114 calls with strike price ranging from 7-20 expiring in JAN/FEB 2023). I am rolling the dice. Why? Because YOLO fother mucker! But I'm also smooth brained and like to eat my own pooh. This is not financial advice. This is just an experiment to make you think. This is not the same market place it once was. Social media has changed the game and what once spelled the demise of a dwindling company could be it's very savior, the people."

1,"So reason I believe $WISH is going too $62 is because I feel there is a secret message I have discovered. It all comes from the hit song Airplanes by B.O.B. Specifically from the lyrics I could really use a $wish right now$Wish right now, $wish right nowCan we pretend that airplanesIn the night sky are like shooting stars?The wish right now wasnt a song at all. It was the ticker marker. And the shooting star is the stock shooting up in value. So now youre asking why $62? Simple. The song released in April 13th 2010 and the songs duration is 3:01. But the duration is actually telling us month and days to add from release date. Meaning the surprise valuation is coming exactly on April + 3 = July 14th. Just 3 weeks away. As for the price valuation, it is because it debuted at 62 on the Canadian 100. But yall may say why Canada? Because maple syrup is delicious. This isnt a meme stock yall. This is a conspiracy unfolded. Yall have 3 weeks to buy as much as possible."

1,"We all know this battle is being drug out by big money; they're losing, they're scared. They're calming down right now because the price is artificially driving down. Revolt, Robinhood, and other brokers are aiding the bears; they're making sure the common (wo)man can't purchase in. It's blatant fucking market manipulation. Do not give up. We will find a way to prevail. If you didn't sell your shares at $450, then DO NOT FUCKING SELL THEM NOW. These bears are going to try any and all tactics they can to win, but DO NOT FUCKING GIVE IN. This is probably (definitely) the most OBVIOUS market manipulation we'll see in our life time. The average investor is winning. We will continue to win.

2,"As it seems, $BODY started trading today in the hopes they are the Netflix of workouts. But does have a pyramid scheme structure with tens of thousands of coaches hurt them? These 'coaches' are not only out of shape, but one of these top coaches killed their oxygen-dependent preemie during their drug and alcohol filled birthday party, stolen peoples families pets and almost killed them, preyed on vulnerable women during pregnancy and postpartum to make more money. They have even told off people when asking real questions. These coaches also balked at covid warnings and would constantly travel in groups and not follow mandates, and boast that covid was not real. There have also been multiple concerns about these coaches pushing shakeology and more to consumers who should not be using the products. There are multiple times coaches do not add disclaimers to posts and lie to get people interested. Do these indiscretions bode well for their business in the long run to have all these people who are supposed to be spokespeople act unprofessionally? Does this signal the end of the coaching network since they are now public? I am really curious how the coaching network can be good for a public company based on how unhealthy and unhinged a lot of the coaches are."

1,"everyone knows AAPL is the only thing keeping the market afloat. I come back here from the pub on a jovial wednesday night in Australia, check the market before going to bed, SPY is holding steady above support but AAPL has flushed right through. Was there some big new I missed? i searched google but couldn't find anything. Is this simply the capitulation event we've all be anticipating and waiting for. another thing i'm wondering is how the SPY is holding up despite this AAPL flush. Literally what happened, regards. Did one of you get drunk, break into the NAZDAQ last night and accidentally put and empty button on the ""short aapl"" button? I'm treading for word count so this post doesn't get auto-deleting, but i think this could potentially move the market in a big way today."

1,Following 3 stocks have at least 50% upside potential in 6 months to 1 year. RiteAid - RAD - current value of 7.50 is good price and retail investor call was good.

This can also be next meme stock with very low valuation.

1,"Like some of you, I have a firm belief that despite the current macro economic climate, the emerging psychedelic medicine sector will continue to move upwards in tandem with regulatory policy. Bottom line,long term, I'm bullish. We're on the tail end of the initial clinical trial push driven by both private and public entities (London Imperial College, UCLA, MAPS, et al.) where the efficacy of medicines such as psilocybin and MDMA has been empirically demonstrated. This will help consolidate the push for patient prescriptions across the spectrum. Additionally, this is a global phenomenon with a total addressable market that includes North America and most countries in South America and Europe. To capture as much value as possible, I'm currently thinking of running an automated investment strategy where every month I invest in the three biggest psychedelic stocks with the best performance over the previous month. Thoughts on this? https://preview.redd.it/v7fwuegbthp91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fe529c773b65c47c87c054a92ba25992de0e10c"

1,God to many memes in here its time to get some real DD back in this sub ###What is LAZR? LAZR is a company that builds sensors for self driving cars it is located in Florida ###What is so great about LAZR? A few things come to mind 1. It's founder is the youngest self made billionaire in history he started with around a 100k and made his first billion by the age of 26 2. The company has three separate self made billionaires investing in it 3. The company already has contracts with China and Japan and 30 of the largest car manufacturing businesses in the world ###So why has the stock tanked so hard since 2020???? That's a stupid question we are in a bear market very few things are going to come out of this unscathed ###Why did a analyst lower its price target??? Also a stupid question it's obvious because most analysis are overpaid people with fancy degrees that like to pretend they understand the market when in reality no one truly knows what will happen we are all just guessing. ###So why should I listen to you??? You shouldn't do your own DD but I'm serious when I say that by 2030 its going to make people super wealthy! It's like buying TSLA when it first came out Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk

The ONLY difference is that the company was divided into 2 equal entities, and one was given to shareholders to cover 50% of the whole company. Each of the 2 stonks is half of the company!!!! And neither can be diluted without a vote, which has not been asked for to the best of my knowledge. So, WTF is going on, besides MAJOR market manipulation and shareholders giving away APE!"

0,"What a wild week and what a crazy finish to the day. Despite the bearish sentiment in the markets the one thing that is clear people are taking profits along the way. Does that mean we are at the bottom? Or does it mean people are playing drop to drop? Lets take a look. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/rz8kmhqhbop91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f86a8944f0851f8602b78c1a97ab4094947c4cf4 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/47znqe9ibop91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56e9bfed9e12b23fc284feabd5281c6dd8f2983b Lets take a look at the SPY daily. WE actually have a VERY interesting trend forming. Lets take a look back at June. Two days before CPI SPY was trading at 415.82. It then went into a two day sell off leading into CPI followed by another sell off leading into FOMC which was then followed up with two days of selling before the bottom was put in at 362.17. Total sell off of 13% with the bottom being a breakdown of the weekly 200ema but a closure over the 200ema on a Friday. Now lets look at the present day SPY. We were trading at 411.73 one day before CPI that led into a CPI sell off into FOMC and we are now two days post FOMC and we just hit 363.29. That would be a total sell off of about 12%. We just broke through the weekly 200ema and rallied EOD to close over it. Looking at the daily candle we just put in a massively long hanging man candle and left a large almost $3 gap about to 373.44. We have clearly established ourselves in this downward channel and we have now broken into the red zone which is 351.21 to 370.7. After SPY put in 4 red days in a row I would be a little surprised to see a 5th red day Monday. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/5n24xbribop91.png?width=714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e3597ab930f4152a7b90a76b3eca9010efc1ad &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/8q1rhd8jbop91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3e98804e44e47f6dc29edd65c728da8d46c67a Now the weekly is quite interesting with what we saw happen today. We just broke the orange dotted support line which dates back to the 2020 covid crash recovery and is also precisely where the June low bounced. Now the one interesting thing is that we did bounce hard and managed with an impressive $5+ rally EOD to close back over the 200ema. This means we still havent closed below the weekly 200ema in over 2 years. The last time this happened was June and as you saw that was the bottom. Monday very well in my opinion could be green. The last time this happened in June spy opened 1.2% green. Now when we look at supports and resistance here when it comes to supports some of these are going to be projections/ trajectories based off historic data and are more educated guesses since we have not spent time down here in a very long time.

That was a very hard bounce and 3660-3670 continues to be stout support. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/kuekkt7kbop91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ea3bdcbd9f5a8cb2082390f07961df876c8cb9 Having broken that weekly support again these supports will be projections based on historical price action. The biggest take away form the weekly is that we hard bounced off the 200ema and much like SPY refused to close below it once again. Key support- 3676 -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3442 -&gt; 3415 Key resistance- 3825 -&gt; 3900 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0y06v3pkbop91.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ef0c4c8dbf020d0d025f7613ecf0b9b9098be87 Interestingly enough Apple daily actually looks fairly bullish. While we did see 150.7 support break down and Apple did temporarily break through that 149.2 support it failed to break and make a new weekly low. Closing out a dragonfly doji on the downside here. I would too be looking for a relief rally much like we saw on September 19th. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0ot0pz4lbop91.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec1199d9e85479dc3a6d5835b00872973d39679f Apples weekly candle closed out with a gravestone doji with one heck of an impressive wick and closing below the candle body of the previous week. Generally a gravestone doji at the top of a run would signal downside much like we saw the week of August 15th, however, on a down trend as you can see during the April/ May sell off a gravestone on a downtrend can actually lead to bigger sell off. Apple did hold that 149.3 support EOD. Key support- 149.3 -&gt; 145.7 -&gt; 142.7 Key resistance- 155.8 -&gt; 158.1 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/q31qeqllbop91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=082195f4eb12ccdc742bd97f0d44ca3853ea07a4 Of all the charts I would say that Tesla is the bearish of them all. I called out on Wednesday that with that rejection of the 312 level and breaking the daily 8ema that I suspected Tesla to be the best short of them all. Turns out I was correct. We not only saw a bigger sell off we broke through support of that red bull channel. Tesla is one that held support and failed to fully breakdown compared to SPY and the rest of tech. As you can see by my blue arrows we are actually seeing a nice inverse head and shoulder forming with a price target of 222 to 252 in the next 2-3 weeks. I still think Tesla at this point will be a great short, though I expect an overall market bounce on Monday. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/e709tb5mbop91.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=759ceb53d15a0dfb3bd1a565d28d56ff864c810a Tesla weekly broke through that bull channel support also and closed below the daily 8, 20, and 50ema. WE should look for a test of that 244 support in the next week or two with a potential for 222 in the next 3-4 weeks. Key support- 272 -&gt; 258 -&gt; 244.4 Key resistance- 288 -&gt; 300.2 My anticipation still remains an overall bounce in the markets followed be most likely a sell off into Friday. Quarterly options expiration is on Friday. I do expect us to see a bigger rally come Friday and I do believe that is going to start the next leg up. However, as we saw yesterday with the massive rally EOD too there is a chance people took profits EOD today only to re-up their position for today. However, EOD today we did not see the same last second drop that we saw on Thursday which to me tells me people did not fully up re-up their positions. SPY has now dropped about 16% from the August 16th high. While there is obviously a bigger shift into a bearish sentiment I still am someone who believes we need to see continued catalysts to sell. Today was one of the first days where we had a true selloff (even tho a lot of that happened overnight and was erased EOD with that push) without a catalyst. Historically per CNBC next week is the worst week for markets, if that is true we could very well end up making a new 52week low. However, I will say failing to touch a new 52week low with -250 sell pressure (thats super high as -5 to -10 is normal) does say a lot. This was clearly not capitulation and I am really not sure what will cause that and if we ever even get it. 10% challenge- &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/2o8fw5rmbop91.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1907a6ee324fff24864c183d5410b7fc7d032947 Overall I was gone a lot today so I didnt do much trading.

1,"Alright listen up you retarded apes. After this weeks move its time we revisit BABA. First my personal thoughts on why the move: everybody and their mother knows BABA is fundamentally undervalued but have been staying on the sidelines like scared little bitches because of some vague China fears. Same thoughts are running on the institutional side and majority of hedge funds being the sheep they are, theyre all afraid to act first and pull the trigger. With the public news of ARKK and a couple other funds buying up BABA and other Chinese stocks this has finally signaled to the other hedgies that its okay to invest in China and now theyre all trying to pile back in at the same time. Institutional FOMOs gonna drives this beast back up. So imo the recent moves been sentiment driven but we havent even triggered any of the fundamental catalysts yet thatll further pump this bitch to the moon. Heres some to name a few, all likely due later this year or early next: 1. ANT IPO. Lot of ancillary news coming out around this such as Ant being approved to operate a consumer finance company by regulators, working together with state owned companies to create a credit scoring company. This shows Ant and the regulators are willing and able to work together. And making headwinds fast.2. Listing of 9988 on the HKSE Stock Connect Southbound program. This means Chinese investors would finally be allowed to trade the stock and you bet these rich fuckers wont have the same hesitations American apes will about YOLOing into their home grown crown jewel company. This gets revisited if HKSE gets 55% share of outstanding shares traded vs the ADR. MSCI the giant index fund has already migrated their shares over from BABA to 9988 and other funds might follow suit to protect their shares in light of fears over US delisting Chinese stocks.3. Earnings release - important number to look out for imo is BABAs operating profits on their cloud computing arm Alicloud. Theyve invested a ton of money into cloud computing and gotten huge market share. So far theyve always reported an operating loss on this but the numbers are improving every quarter and theyre on the cusp of finally being in the green now. This year might be when they finally turn a profit. For those who know, this was when AMZN skyrocketed and the same will happen to BABA when they finally get there. Cloud computing is a huge cash cow with big profits low costs thatll be a huge boon on their operating margins which has been one of the only fundamental weak points of the company so far.4. 13F filings for Q2. We all know the stock popped when Charlie Munger disclosed a position. We may see another if we see him adding to the position or if any of his other value investing buddies like Buffett getting in on it too. For those who are worried they missed the move its not too late still. My guess is therell probably be a pullback next week so you apes have a window to get in before its too late. I know Ill be adding to my position and my tits are already thoroughly jacked on this one to begin with. Lastly, just look at BABAs net profit last year: $21bn. What was AMZNs net profit that year? $21bn. Except AMZNs market cap is $1.7 trillion and BABAs is $620bn. In other words AMZN is valued 2.8x higher than BABA for generating the exact same profits. Plenty of money to still be made here. Tl;dr buy some BABA if you want to make money you fking retards."

Also, October is around the corner and well get to see Teslas delivery numbers. The expected wait times has shortened which could indicate a bear case and a bull case the Bear case is that there is a crazy amount of cancellations which have been the result of closing showrooms in China. The bull case is that production in the giga factories have been getting better and they are delivering cars at a much more comfortable pace. Then earnings, expected 10/18-10/24 (not official). Not sure if the currency changes will be such a big factor to the downside. But perhaps deliveries will aid that. All in all, Im bullish Tesla. Its a mega cap that has been performed relatively well.

Its true. Hedge funds have been shorting GME this entire time. Especially on the way up. Though I cant say for the really big names like Melvin, my dad used to work in this industry and his friends still manage and own some smaller hedge funds. These past weeks theyve been basically gloating to him about shorting the stock as it kept hitting all time highs. They think were idiots and are capitalizing on all of this waiting for us to fumble.

I didn't explain to you all here that I made a program that calculated the odds out for me. I'm actually a bit of a quantitative analyst. So I started working on my program some more and I ironed out a few kinks, and my program gave some interesting results after the fomc conference. It caught a correlation and it gave a very high degree of accuracy of the following: https://preview.redd.it/qafgqmpchqp91.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ce3f9bdec7aa272bf3bbc8cff2e5f9a1f75db5b Here's what I predicted on 9/21, and here's what actually happened: https://preview.redd.it/dl32l3rnhqp91.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bd1ec7d5e7109d2e502866dfc2f55a3719ec87b TWO days ago I made a prediction of todays open and nailed it, TO THE PENNY. If you guessed every trading day what the open would be, to the penny for TSLA, you would only get it right once every 8.75 years or so. I also was only 2 pennies off from nailing the close of yesterday. And only 32 cents of from nailing the open of yesterday. Here's proof that I called the things before they happened: Here's where I posted it on [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com/ItAlwaysWorksOut/message/486290636) Here's a screen shot of that post: https://preview.redd.it/17y6f9etiqp91.jpg?width=670&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b259472bc405967e9a3326af7abb89de8e658162 The odds of getting THAT accurate are astonishing. It blows my mind. I calculated the odds out and to get the close of yesterday within two pennies, followed by the open dead on, would only happen after 1,441,464 guesses ( Or 5720 years). Now here's the part for you! The program also calculates with a high degree of accuracy that TSLA will open on monday at $268.36 and close on monday at $259.43."

1,"Please forgive my ignorance as I have been bullish on this stock for way too long. With the housing market coming out of the largest BOOMS (at least that I can recall) which caused house prices to skyrocket , there has still remained a downward trend on rocket mortgage. I understand that interest rates were low, but the houses were costing double which shouldve made every deal rocket mortgage signed worth double. Now to the refinance side of things! Right now, no one in their right mind would want to refinance, especially if they are locked in at a low interest rate. This also can benefit rocket mortgage as they will keep customers locked in at higher interest rates due to the fed hikes. Any basic amortization calculator can show that locked in mortgages will pay better than letting someone refinance in a couple years to cut their rate in half. Not to mention what is happening on the auto side of things, and all the big events $RKT sponsors. I believe that this stock is extremely undervalued for the conditions we currently live in, but I am curious what everyone else thinks?!?"

0,"CNBCs Jim Cramer on Thursday said that inflation could soon decline, leaning on charts analysis from legendary technician Larry Williams. The charts, as interpreted by Larry Williams, suggest that inflation could soon cool down substantially soon if historys any guide, he said. Cramer's comments come after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points and reiterated its hawkish stance against inflation. To explain Williams analysis, the Mad Money host first examined a chart of the current Federal Reserve sticky price consumer price index (in black) compared to the burst of inflation in the late seventies and early eighties (in red). https://preview.redd.it/1bh8g604ulp91.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7305f198b4097c9fb87203843034544081d982c9 Williams notes that the current trajectory of sticky price inflation has closely hugged this historical pattern, Cramer said. He added that when situated in the pattern of inflation in the late seventies and early eighties, current inflation is roughly in the 1980 point of the trajectory which is around when inflation peaked then. Today, unlike back then, the Fed knows exactly how to beat inflation, and Jay Powell has shown that hes willing to bring the pain. That means it should peak sooner, Cramer said.

Think of it as being naked short the Dollar. ;-) With rising prices persisting due to all the inflation created over the last couple years, it's not necessarily a bad bet that the dollar is losing value. Admittedly it's been gaining against OTHER BS Fiat currencies, but its purchasing power is still falling like a rock. Debt is simply borrowing dollars now, selling them into the market (for gas and food if you're like most Americans, or for an income producing asset if you're smart), then buying them back at a later date to make a payment on the loan. The only question is, can you remain solvent enough to pay the fees while you wait for the bottom to drop out of the BS USD... even while all your necessities are getting more and more expensive. Hope that helps! :-)"

1,"Target is currently trading at around $240 per share. Firstly, I believe it's undervalued based on its price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.58, when compared to its competitors (COSTCO has a P/E of 36.589, Walmart has a P/E of 31.829). A look at the Enterprise value to EBIDTA ratio (EV/EBIDTA) tells a similar story. It should be noted, though, that TGT has a higher debt-to-equity of 1.02 ratio than some Costco and Walmart, although it isn't high enough to raise concerns about its risk. Based on fundamentals alone, it seems like a solid pick. This is supported by the fact that it absolutely crushed earnings back in April, beating EPS by a whopping 104.36% and revenue by a reasonable 14.24%. It saw a nice pump after earnings was disclosed, but it has still steadily increased in price since then (6.1% in the last month). I think that it will continue to grow now that summer is here and there is increased shopping, not to mention reopening and lifting of COVID restrictions.

Im not here to pretend like I know what the fucking market is going to do or that I called something out etc. because obviously no that makes no sense. But all I wanted to say is to whoever read that comment and said to themselves, This guys an idiot, he doesnt know what the fuck hes talking about, well you would be correct. But, SPY did close at $375.00 today, Jesus Christ"

2,"Hi all. I spoke in the pre-market about how I believe that Monday is going to be horrendous for the whole UK, but I wanted to take the time to write a whole ass essay about why, because I believe there's some nuance that couldn't be shared over a quick voice chat. TL:DR - the UK is poised to fall into an '08 tier recession, is already sliding there, and as much as I hate to admit it, now is a good time to be a rainbow bear. So, first off, I stand with my assertion that Monday is going to be a bloodbath. Why? Because that's the first trading day after the energy price cap changes. On Saturday, the price cap on energy will be raised significantly, meaning that nearly the whole country is going to face an increase in energy bills that will, for many, simply be untenable, or at the very least, impossible to pay without massive cutbacks to spending. I'm talking anywhere up to about 200 a month extra per month, with some households set to get even higher, depending on supplier and usage. There's no way around it, this is going to be utterly brutal. But if that were the only thing happening right now, then we might be able to get away with it. After all, other European countries are dealing with crazy energy prices, but here's why I believe the UK isn't just fucked, but UNIQUELY fucked. For a live play-by-play of the chancellor's meeting with banks and the BOE, see this insightful video: [Kwasi Kwarteng.mp4](https://youtu.be/MFX0MggWdNc) So, apart from the price of keeping homes warm as winter approaches reaching a staggering new high, with January poised to possibly make it even worse, there's also some other juicy factors. Factors such as, say, the Bank Of England jacking interest all the way up to 6 percent by next year: [actually a real article and not a shitpost](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/26/pound-sterling-uk-interest-rates-bank-of-england) . Oh baby, you know you love some big, fat interest. That big, fat interest, mind you, is already making folks' house moves fall through, and is pretty much set to make any borrowing extra hard for the people who need loans and mortgages the most. Who, incidentally, are the ones about to be buttfucked-no-lube-spiky-drilldo-style by the cataclysmic energy price rises. Are we starting to see the problem here? Then there's the inflation. No, not the kinky kind, more the kind that makes barrels a leading fashion choice. That inflation is still at near enough %10, driven mostly by food [real source 2, electric boogaloo](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/august2022) and other living expenses. In layman's terms, the UK has experienced an increase of about five or so years of inflation, all at once, to coincide with the first wave of truly bonkers energy price rises. And finally, what of wages? [live feed from downing street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhckuhUxcgA) but no, seriously, wages aren't going up to help people pay for this shit. SO what's the government doing about all this? Surely they have a plan? Didn't I hear something about the BOE eating debt just to keep the economy stable? Yes, you did. Because UK pension funds just got margin called for enough money to invade Iraq with. Yeah, you bet I got a source for that: [Margin calls - not just for WSB idiots any more](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7954682/uk-pensions-hit-with-ps100m-margin-calls-as-gilts-and-sterling-slide) . But that's not all, folks, no, because, you see, the government are going to be giving everyone a 400 payment to help with energy bills and are going to be cutting all the taxes, everywhere. Except that payment isn't going to go very far, and not even the UK banks or the actual motherfucking IMF think the chancellor's recent economic plans is a good idea. [real source 4: this time it's personal.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/09/28/ftse-100-markets-live-news-pound-bonds-bank-england/) If the people in the glass buttplug think your economic policy is shit, it's probably shit. Oh, and the pound saw its lowest value since decimalisation, so, effectively, the lowest it's ever been. Here's one last article, from goddamn Bloomberg to hammer it home: [Real Source 5: the source awakens.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-26/emerging-market-currency-crisis-tag-is-alarming-for-britain) So, in summary: the UK is going to fall into a recession hard and fast, and October is going to be one of the worst months since 'rona hit. Plays: Puts on anything in the FTSE100, calls on barrels, dollar/pound shenanigans."

1,"Tesla is now in second place for total sh0rt 1nteres1 (mods )I like this stock. It is time. Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However Im thinking about a few things: Presidential cycles: (formatted weird due to some rules) For like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year. Teslas trend: Absolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, Im doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD. NOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY: It really isnt. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elons commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, its just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I dont expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but Id rather bet on the company with the biggest head start. Elon Musk: You gotta love him. Hes helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And hes an absolute savage. Im also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as hes already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors. TLDR: Why the fuck havent we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you dont like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wifes boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS in 2 years?

This is a basic market mechanics trade. Is the short % of float over 100% = Yes Is there a reason the short % of float has gone even higher since the drop = Yes Did the Ryan Cohen sell change the market mechanics of this trade = No Did GME and AMC both drop before they had their squeeze = Yes Is BBBY playing out the exact same patter as every other big squeeze play = Yes Is the Broad market in a bullish euphoric period and overall rallying = Yes This looks worth a bet to me.
