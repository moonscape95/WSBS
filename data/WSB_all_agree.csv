1,"We got 2 gaps to be closed, market is oversold at this point and the rate hike was 75 bps not 100 bps. Past few days of selling is a shake out, all this was already backed in. In the next 2 to 3 weeks we're blasting higher and if the bulls can close the gap at 4080 to 4108 and continue higher the bears are going to feel the squeeze. We closed with a decent hammer and hopefully bull have put in the bottom going into next week.

1,"Grayscale Trust Selling at a huge discount. will climb when it forks to proof of stake. ETHE will get both forks, will probably sell off the proof of work stake and pay a special dividend. Then the trust will most likely start paying a dividend when it gets paid for its proof of stake. Could be 12% or more per year. Plus ETHE is heavily shorted. This is rocketing higher this month. No doubts."
1,"Supreme Court is going to decide on the case of West Virginia v. EPA tomorrow and based on previous opinions from the court, Im pretty confident theyre going to limit the EPAs power.

This will be a big boon for the utility companies, especially those that still have a lot of coal plants in operation like Duke Energy."

0,"War is driven by profit. This is magnified by long-time inclusion of war companies into the S&amp;P500 and other prominent stock indices like the DOW. Most people work hard and try to grow their wealth through investment. Historical results clearly show that investing into companies representing the S&amp;P500 is a good idea. Naturally, this translates into a situation where the people themselves are incentivized into growing the S&amp;P500 further. The US economy, as dire as it looks, is now at a point where market capitalizations of prominent corporations are now in the Trillions of dollars. Capitalism has made the USA so powerful that companies that are considered Small are worth Billions of dollars. This maturity of the US economy is so substantial that war companies cannot compete anymore with Technology and other businesses that are thriving. There are not enough bombs and places to bomb that can ever sustain profitability for these companies without hijacking the citizens' tax dollars through US ""defense"" spending and other leechlike tactics. Our society is at a point in time where we do not have a real need for war companies any longer. However, there are misaligned incentives that are still in place. As long as these companies represent a significant portion of the S&amp;P500 and other indices there will always be a stirring hunger towards unnecessary conflicts in the world. It's time to cut off the head of the snake and de-list them from the S&amp;P500. This will start a massive push towards their irrelevancy and they will no longer be supported by the money machine."
1,"It's the day after FOMC and markets are selling off. $MSFT, however, briefly dipped below its June lows and has since recovered, making it one of the few large-cap stocks in the green today. That being said, this dip below support could be a deviation before pushing higher or the beginning of much more downside ahead. Regardless, something of interest to note right now is that the number of MSFT social mentions, as tracked by LunarCrush, is showing sustained growth with more and more people creating posts and talking about Microsoft Corp (MSFT) right now at these price levels. [$MSFT Price &amp; Social Mentions \(1-Year Activity\)](https://preview.redd.it/xk8m052t3gp91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=949dd21edb92d4706dd3e50572a672d6e82cea1c) I find this interesting because, for the first time since $MSFT's ATH back in Nov 2021, the social activity around $MSFT is trending up again, after months of trending down. So according to this data, there is a peak of interest in MSFT right now and it continues to grow. Whether this peak of interest in MSFT is short-sighted or long-sighted is up to interpretation but is interesting nonetheless. What do you guys think about this? Is $MSFT's rising social activity a bullish sign? Are people fearful right now? Are they wanting to buy? Let's discuss!"
2,"Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Sep 15, the very next day, SPY rallied, same week it even gapped up 10 points.

2,"CFVI was a SPAC that just got approval for the merger and will be merging with Rumble Video $RUM on Monday. When the deal was announced the stock quickly tanked to the SPAC floor price of $10 and stayed at $10 for an entire year.

0,"The penny is basically worthless. That's what hedgies want you to think. Sure, we can round everything to the nearest 0.05. Sure, Big Zinc has lost significant power. Sure, the penny costs too much to produce. That's the narrative. Quietly, behind the scenes, capital management funds are increasing their penny reserves. Why? Because the penny offers legitimate long term value. In an inflation ridden world, the death of the penny is inevitable. Long term the penny represents true, inflation resistant value. That's because it will become scarce - only 21 trillion have ever been produced. And if the price drops the demand for the penny will surge. With the growing population, the world desperately needs the zinc for vitamins. Tldr - hide your kids, hide your wife, hide your pennies."
0,"But it still means someone took the 10k initially. Compared to today, they made a 1k profitWith stocks, if I buy 1 share at 100 dollars and next day it drops to 50 dollars, I only lost money when I sell - but if I sell at 50 dollars, the first guy might buy it again, which means my 50 dollar loss is *exactly* his 50 dollar gain. So it is zero-sum Its only ever not zero-sum when stocks either keep climbing forever (i.e. economic growth) or decline to zero, making them worthless. Anything in between is zero sum"

SWBI stock cannot be stopped as of now, so hop on the train and ride it to ape city. The shorting will only help us. Dont take my word for it though, do a little research and see for yourself!

1,"BBBY just had a spike on its MACD from 0.48 to 1.61 a 3.3x increase. GME experienced a similar bump in Jan 2021. 0.98 to 5.45, a 5.5x increase. GME only had a 5.5x pop the week after its entire option chain went ITM. As of now, BBBY's entire option chain is over 80% ITM. If BBBY goes to 45 before Friday, it's safe to say this thing will blow to GME regard levels. I'm buying call options +50% above share price when the new chain is out. Currently hold 45$ AUG 19 call options. Holding until tomorrow because I expect massive AH/PM movement with this much volume. I do not think brokers are capable of settling this many trades which will lead to force settlements in the AH/PM before opening bell tomorrow. By law, you shares have to be settled before opening bell T+2. With the massive volumes we've been having, I highly doubt they've been able to keep up meaning they'll have to buy AH or PM before Thursday. If the volume keeps up the way it is, it's just going to keep chaining and chaining and this is gonna be stupid."

In other words they bet on the stock to go down, and at a certain date they will be obligated to by shares at the market price at that time. Is that correct?

1,Right now I'm a really big fan of dollar tree and metro inc. (MRU-TSE). My reasoning is metro owns the most low end food stores in Canada (food basics) and no matter what happens with the economy people will still have to eat. Same with dollar tree. People will still need everyday items and imo will switch from Walmart Target ect. To a cheaper alternative.

0,"Some simple math for y'all... SPY is down about 19% from its high. In the prior 20 years or so the market has had much larger declines. After the dotcom bust it declined about 42% and during the Housing bust it declined about 48%. A measly 19% drop off outrageous highs is a mere curiosity. If you want to know what will happen with the market... it might decline another 20% or so, it might go up or it might stay flat. In the long-run it should go up especially with inflation going to drive nominal increases long-term in earnings."

2,"As exciting as it is to live through these once in life time moments they are getting quite old. Today we just closed our 6th red day in a row This is something that has not happened since the Feb 2020 covid crash which saw 7 red days in a row and dropped 15.7% over that time period. SPY currently has fallen 7.4% over 6 days now. Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I havent felt capitulation or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. CNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the worst week of the year for stocks with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with I wonder how this week is going to finish out. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/tkfhdtxyahq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22112a516715d92cf1c159a93a57b3a5e9bfbea5 Looking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. The one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didnt just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight. Support- 362.1 -&gt; 360.2 (red support) -&gt; 358.2 (blue support) -&gt; 355.4 -&gt; 352.3 Resistance- 364.3 -&gt; 365.6 (red resistance) -&gt; 368.2 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 373.7 (blue resistance and gap fill) &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/31g6d9hzahq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b228a328b8a341912e0b7d350cedd73b32f1b9 Taking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. Key support- 3635 -&gt; 3615 (blue support) -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3545 Key resistance- 3670 -&gt; 3706 (blue resistance) -&gt; 3770 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/mul8f900bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=381e87f542780f0db41d5345bedf97b0f419ed3c Looking at apple this morning once again which has been trend for the last week we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. I was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. The thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we havent hit capitulation and we havent been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. Key supports- 150.7 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.1 Key resistance- 152.4 -&gt; 154.5 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/rabr1ak0bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421f0e076579dbbf7cccfc8a56f8f154fa23a45e Tesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. Tesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. Support- 270.3 -&gt; 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) Resistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 292 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/5gasyw21bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6448fd81850b4f6eed3e8b5f0f007ea3619718d7 Just when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50 I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in. I am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I havent really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. The next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. 10% challenge- &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/bqhagwr1bhq91.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccfb99337d2ece731e9d1ada0d441082a2798fec You know honestly not my best day today I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. From there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. This is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being smarter than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. I am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really dont know where to go from here but thats why when in doubt we dont swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. Overall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight.

2,"AMC Entertainment stock was sinking fast on Monday and had dropped more than 11% in trading after the theater chain announced a new distribution agreement to sell up to $1.4 billion worth of APE shares. The so-called APE shares, or AMC Preferred Equity Units, have the same economic value and voting rights as a share of common stock. The idea was for AMC to use the proceeds from the sale of the new stock to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase existing debt, as it said in Mondays filing. The APEs are even named after the meme traders that helped to boost the companys stock price last year. The market however soured at that idea, and while the APEs are up on the day, theyve dropped 41% in value in the past month since the new stocks were first announced by Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron on August 22 at a price of $6, now sitting at $3.78. Meanwhile, AMCs stock itself over that same period has also dropped 21.1%. While it was disclosed that up to 425 million shares of APEs would be sold, the announcement is a placeholder and does not specifically indicate how many will ultimately be sold or by when. Aron has previously argued that since the shares are going to already existing shareholders rather than going directly on sale, APEs would not dilute AMCs stock value. With the creation of APEs, AMC is deeply and fundamentally strengthening our company. Given the flexibility that APEs will give us, we will likely be able to raise money if we need or so choose, which inmmensely lessens any survival risk as we continue to work our way through this pandemic to recovery and transformation, Aron said in the letter announcing their creation last month.

2,"The DXY is at 20 year highs while inflation is at 40yr highs and interest rates are at 10+ yr highs. The fed stopped 14 years of printing. Half the small businesses in the world are still recovering from the pandemic. There's a war that's realigned directly and indirectly most of the world's energy supply chains and fucked assume of the poorest nations on earth's food supply chains. Energy and food are near if not at at all time highs - globally. Even in net exporting Australia our electricity is flying, blackouts are threatened, and lettuce is like $10 a head. The banks, globally didn't learn a thing they weren't forced to. Basel 17 our whatever they're up to now looks like it might get tested soon. The Fed, ECB, JCB can't bail them out right now if they fuck up - and I doubt the long feared ""derivatives time bomb"" ever got papered over enough to defuse it. Housing is another global time bomb - high historical prices and high current interest rates mix like butter and glue. I could keep going. Point is, at some point, and it may have already happened (Evergrande?) something has to give. Somewhere, someone, a company or nation, will default Lehman style, and it won't be contained - and more importantly, no central bank or government will be able to rescue it. I won't pretend to know how it will happen this time but most of the time it's counterparty risk that does it. One default cascades to the people they borrowed from, then they default, then it snowballs, then credit seizes up as no one trusts any borrower to repay, forcing central banks to intervene - but can they this time? Pouring bailouts on top of generational inflation highs seems unlikely. Given their generally delusional forecasts and commentary (""transitory"" anyone?) it seems most likely they won't act early. Most likely outlying probably be too late. Governments, generally speaking are already in huge debts, and the central banks will be reluctant to backstop bailouts - especially in poorer countries with already high USD denominated debt. Again, DXY at 20yr highs means they're already struggling to make repayments. Something has to give. Call me a , but tell me, is my assessment overlooking some great optimistic hope?"

Billionaire Investor Leon Cooperman, said ""In a bear market, he who loses least, wins."" Opendoor bragged of having a huge number of variables and algorithms in their AI to beat the market. Well...they got out the market. So doesn't that basically confirm shit is about to hit the fan? So basically if we are to buy a home it should be once they announce they are buying again?"
1,Cineworld (ticker CINE) has been punted down to one and a half pence on the London stock exchange but has risen around 12pm GMT to 0.02 4% increase. It is certainly being shorted by hedgfunds. I am asking the apes out there if you can spare 20.00 to help take this stock away from oblivion and stick it to the hedge funds. For 20.00 you can pick up around 1000 stocks.
2,"SIX aka Six flags has been performing worse and worse over the years as the market for theme parks decline and consumers spend more on electronic entertainment. Currently SIX is deemed overvalued by more than $3 (according to yahoo finance), and has missed EPS the last quarter and only met EPS in the other two due to low predictions. Monetary policy has become so aggressive that consumers more than ever will hesitate to spend especially on something as outdated as theme parks + we are going into winter and the likely hood of another ""varient"" (even tho its probs just a flu variant) is likely to appear soon. No one goes to theme parks in the winter and there is only one in Georgia that can possibly attract customers on warmer winter days (but with climate/tempreture extremes I doubt more than ever that will happen). Six flags additionally pays for its properties with loans, these are property loans and are thus not fixed. Six flags is gonna be forced to pay for these properties with cashflow it doesn't have in an industry already dying. &amp;#x200B; Big investors already know this and the downward trend we saw this afternoon proves that this is an industry that is and will continue to be fucked hard by jpow trying to be a wannabe volckner. &amp;#x200B; Earnings come out OCT 25th but I predict SIX dumping sometime this early oct as prices drop and hedgies and bulge bracket banks begin to pump and dump to setup positions. &amp;#x200B; Maybe this is already happening... but def not the bottom"
0,Seriously want to know the subs thoughts on SPCE. They have a lot of plans for space travel from training camp resorts to multiple launches back to back and ships under construction that can handle higher capacity of customers. Legit asking if this community sees them as having a chance in the space race. This will probably be seen by few but I'll take whatever at this point. 3 day weekend BBBY break on the sub so maybe people will read. Can someone translate this to memes for the non readers?

0,If you were around for the game squeeze...it was never about the fundamentals of the company. It's about the funds that have shorted the sgit out of a company! RC is not a factor. Making the shorts cover is where it's at!!!!
1,BBBY is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. &amp; Now.. there is catylist to short it even more one would think. Shorts having to cover for possibly over 50% free float would be nuts if retail buys in this week.

I would like some criticism and general input.

Because of this I went and did something else and I get a notification that an order filled. I jump back on to see the gap down and thought to myself of course BUT the take-profit was the filled order. The call was just OTM so I doubt it had enough delta to move up enough to trigger the take-profit. So was it the jump in volatility that spiked the price of the option (and saved my bacon)?"

ARLP is currently $17.89 a share, and you can buy $15 2024 calls for $4.50 per at the mid. Gives you a breakeven of 19.50, or 9% above the current price. Not only are you buying ITM, you also get a year and a half of runway. Alliance Resource Partners is primarily a coal company, with some oil/gas ties. I personally am extremely bullish on coal in particular, so I plan on buying a decent amount of LEAPs very soon."

Periodicities comparison to the volkswagon gamma have us at the exact time period when the price during the final leg4 of the squeeze runs up to 'infinity' levels. Don't have trigger hands: hold your position until you can afford that yacht. Here we go.
1,"Guys, just take a minute and zoom out your vision from stocks like $GME and $AMC and realize that $GOOG $GOOGL is at an extremely rare valuation right now. Even if it drops more from here you are getting a great price for it, I wouldn't pass this up... Google is now trading for a 16x forward earnings and 11x EBITDA. Its not as sensitive to supply chain issues and inflation as other companies are. Google is literally the internet and not going anywhere and is a huge monopoly with no competitors even dreaming of coming close. It is also extremely oversold with an RSI below 30 and at 52 week lows. This is one of those All-In opportunities that you can feel proud of and brag to your dads boyfriend about. Again... We are talking about freaking Google here, everyone uses Google and Google uses everyone. I have been loading shares under $100. Anyways this is my opinion and not my financial advise yada yada"

2,Patience friend. It'll go lower. Average Joe needs to start pulling money from funds (ie not retail) when they can afford bread in the brave new world.

1,"There is an ongoing fight for Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) between $ULCC and $JETS. My question is, why is nobody talking about this or buying it? Apparently, at the start $ULCC and $SAVE were supposed to merge where $ULCC would acquire $SAVE and deal would be for approximately $25.84. Then $JETS saw that and offered cash to buy $SAVE and they keep throwing more and more cash on this deal, I think up to $33 per share. Now, currently $SAVE is trading around $22, so if any of these deals goes through = free money. If not, then you are still buying an airline stock for fairly cheap in an environment where air travel is increasing. And for those who like to YOLO, there is some sort of $SAVE shareholder meeting tonight where they would decide (hopefully) what is the future of the company and what deal they want to go with."

If you look at the GME cult sub, they create their own tinfoil hat theories, preach them, circlejerk and it goes on and on. No official data is correct to them - everything is FUD. There is literally no fact they cannot twist to present it as a FUD to make them sell. These apes have been bent over many times already but they continue believing in fairy tales and cherry-picking data to justify their wet fantasies. Any information that doesn't justify the bag holder's bias is FUD. Which means you must become a blind sheep and follow the fake DD until your losses are 100%. Be smart.

Nasdaq dropped 80% and took 15 years to recover! **At the end of July 2008** , Cramer called the bottom.Specifically, he said the bear market was over and it was time to back up the truck.

This cause a lot of write downs and a loss on the quarter. This was latched onto by the institutional shorts and here we are - a good company being shorted into the ground. Buy the calls! Buy the stock!

0,"I have a question If at the start of the day I look at SPY and buy 5 options for out of the moneybouts expiring today priced at approx $0.50 each and then try to sell them with limit orders at $0.6, $0.70, $0.80,$0.90 and $1.0. Would that be profitable overtime doing that daily? If they go above $1 then I'm done and I made $150, but if they expire as worthless I lose $500, but don't sub $1 options bounce around a lot? Couldnt I tried trade them and make a profit before they all expire at the end of the day?"

What do you all think? Does this stock still have some legs left to run, or is it bound for the trashcan? Strangely it didn't move at all today with the big jump after FOMC. Not sure why..seems like it should've gotten a little bit of love at least. I really want this thing to run to $8 before the end of the year.

They are now on panic mode stage, I would not be surprised if theyre holding meetings with NASDAQ, regulators, and big banks to see what can be done to stop the madness because theres no way they can fulfill these obligations.

Buying 20k now and then again in a month for the next 4-5 months is NOT DCA'ing despite what some might tell you. To be successful at DCA'ing you should be looking at a typical market cycle of 4-6 years. The balance can sit in CDs and bonds right now and make 3.5%. CDs and bonds will also help with keeping you diversified. All of this is opinion and not financial advice :)"

1,"As the world looks for new ways to implement clean energy into our everyday lives, switching from gas-powered vehicles to electric is at the top of the list. Major motor vehicle manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford, BMW, Kia, and many others have poured millions of dollars into marketing trying to get a headstart in dominating the global EV market. According to the BBC, in the next three years, 20% of all new cars sold will be electric vehicles, 40% by 2030, and nearly 100% by 2040. Allied Market Research reports that the global EV market was valued at $163.01 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $823.75 billion by the end of the decade, thus giving the industry a compound annual growth rate of 18.2% from 2021-2030. So yeah, the EV market is fully charged right now (pun very much intended). Due to the market's expected growth, picking the right company to invest in has the potential for massive returns.

0,"$INTC has been down-only for close to 17 months now (-58%) and has yet to show any real signs of a bottom forming from a technical analysis perspective. However, there is something of interest going on with $INTC at these incredibly low prices. Despite a bearish stock price, the social activity surrounding $INTC is increasing with sustained growth in the number of social mentions (unique mentions of $INTC), and the number of social contributors (unique people talking about $INTC). Social mentions: 72.9K +50.19%Social contributors: 157 +45.37% **What does this mean? And how can we use this information to our advantage?** The recent rise in $INTC social activity indicates that theres increasing interest in $INTC at these levels. And since the stock price is already down so much, we must ask ourselves **Are the people contributing to this increased interest looking to short $INTC or long $INTC?** Im willing to bet it's the latter. I mean, the stock price is already incredibly low so it's logical to think that people are talking more frequently about $INTC now because they want to buy. Anyways, I think social activity around stocks can be very telling, and its fun to try and decipher what the market is thinking. So, what do you guys think? Is the increase in $INTC social activity bullish? Or bearish?"

Their liquid assets alone are almost equal to their stock price, they have little debt, they turned a profit for the first time this year, and the P/E is &lt;1 right now. The reason why dry bulking and ZIM are low is because of China's corona outbreak and the war in Ukraine, but those can't go on forever and the demand will inevitably rise.

Today, these metrics seem ludicrous, &amp; it's clear the peak pump was $27. Ever since then all of the bag holders have been trying to start the broken down car that is BBBY. It sputters to $14 only to be annihilated down to $8 once again. On what planet, what dimension, what universe is the CFO committing suicide going to make the stock bullish? One where BBBY is led by competent leaders who will rally together, make risky choices &amp; restructure their business. The only reason anyone on WSB is invested in BBBY is to make quick money.

No-one is buying the fucking 40 series GPU, they wont... When you can get a 3080 or 3090 that's highly competitive for a fraction of the cost, the entire GPU market is going to be going second hand over the next several years and companies like NVDA are going to get assblasted more than anyone else.

The fed knows that expectations are just as important as the actual rate hikes, which is why jpow became volker incarnate at jackson hole. But with their flip flopping in the past, and dovish track record, will he really follow through on his word? I think so, but they may act too slow, as they alrdy have been. I think Jpow needs to bring a 100bp hike next week. Not cause its needed, which it is, but to give his words more credibility. Show that his bark has teeth behind it."

1,"Investing in meme stocks alone is unique by itself. I think we all have an opportunity to invest in things that we either cared about when we were younger or things we enjoy doing. Im might speak out of turn here, but I look at the recovery of Six Flags stock and Im like damn, missed a 5 bagger and it was right there in front of me the whole time. Or you take any business environment that has been disrupted by COVID and some have been quicker to recover than others. Im presenting the bullish case for AMC to be a COVID recovery play and not so much a squeeze play. Granted there are ways in which it could squeeze, but they have been speculation thus far. We have no way knowing the conditions truthfully without data or facts to back it up. Most of what I have seen borders on conspiracy and this is an effort to clear the air. Invest in what you care about! I went to AMC Theaters last Saturday and I had a blast watching Nobody. I got my popcorn, my blue slurpee, and my sour patch kids. I enjoyed my experience. Thats what I paid $50 for. To take my GF and I out to get out of the house and engage in an activity. AMC presents an opportunity to not just invest in something you care about, but also actively contribute to the wellbeing of the company. In so many words you can support your investment by having fun and enjoying the movie going experience. Yes this applies to other theater stocks. But I like AMC, it reminds me of my childhood. AMC has debt. That is a well known factor of this stock. I dont know expressly know their current debt amount, but with people returning to theaters it can recover. I did the math and if everyone in this group on average spent $50 on one movie go including tickets, food, and drink, it would be about $450M if everyone went to the theaters on the same day. Is that realistic? Probably not, but could be a possibility. Imagine with COVID restrictions being lifted later this year what it could do for generating profits? Well you might say, the movie industry is dying. I dont think it is because you pay for an experience to do something fun with your kids, friends, or your wifes boyfriend. I still think regardless of a squeeze play, it can be a recovery play. With or without a squeeze I am bullish and confident in AMC recovering from COVID and moving past the debt hurdle. I like movies and I like the stock!"

0,"Implied volatility is jacked way up thanks to WSB autism which has made options on $BBBY quite pricey. If you own 10,000 shares, you have the opportunity to sell 100 covered calls. Sell the nearest expiration contracts at a strike price youd be happy selling your shares at. For example, sell the $20 strike for 9/2 if you dont mind selling your shares at $20 a pop. These particular contracts are trading at .53 so if you own 10,000 shares you could sell 100 contracts for $5,300 credit. $BBBY closes below $20 on 9/3, you keep the premium and your shares. $BBBY closes above $20 on 9/3, you sell your shares at $20. Do this weekly. Simple PSA to collect some premium on the back of your regarded $BBBY position. GL to all."

Some companies are great but the stock sucks. And vice versa. But SABR is still well below its pre pandemic trade range. It obviously tends to trade with the reopen trade. The GDS network hosts content from all airlines AND the biz model is driven by transaction volume, not pricing. Which of course leads to less cyclical volatility factors. At $15, its below its 52 week high. Still up 25% in the last 3 months. It definitely goes higher from here."

While we continue to invest significantly in the business, we made these adjustments so that our costs are growing in line with our slower revenue growth. We are so grateful for everything they have done for Netflix and are working hard to support them through this difficult transition. &amp;#x200B; Netflix had warned investors in April that it would be pulling back on some of its spending growth over the next two years. &amp;#x200B; Spencer Neumann, the companys chief financial officer, said during the companys earnings call that Netflix is trying to be prudent about pulling back to to reflect the realities of its business.

2,"I'm not going to pretend to know economics, but I do know the Fed has a tendency to over react. They should have left well enough alone during the pandemic. You can't use fiscal policy to combat a unique situation that wasn't exactly economic in nature. There were stimulus payments and inflated unemployment payments to get us through. Slashing the target rate to 0 was short sighted. Now they are going to overdo it again, and by the end of the year we will be sitting at 5%! Why they didn't have the foresight to see this coming last year is beyond me. I did. Historically, it would seem to me at least, 2.25-2.50 strikes a pretty good balance between interest rates, unemployment, and inflation. Sometimes you just have to give it enough time to work!"
2,"Nvidia reported second quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings per share. The report is in line with Nvidias preliminary earnings two weeks ago. The chipmaker warned that it would miss Wall Street estimates and that growth had slowed significantly because of disappointing gaming sales driven by macroeconomic conditions. It also warned its gross margin would drop. Nvidia missed on revenue but Refinitiv estimates didnt change after the company warned on guidance and said it expected to report $6.7 billion in the quarter. Nvidia stock fell over 4% in extended trading. Heres how Nvidia did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates: **EPS: $0.51, adjusted, versus $1.26 expected** **Revenue: $6.7 billion versus $8.10 billion expected** The chipmaker said it expected $5.9 billion in sales in its fiscal third quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates of $6.95 billion. Nvidias gaming department revenue was down 33% year-over-year to $2.04 billion, which was a sharper decline than the company anticipated. Nvidia said that the miss was because of lower sales of its gaming products, which are primarily graphics cards for PCs. Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand for the companys gaming products, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on a call with analysts. Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/nvidia-reports-slowing-growth-after-earlier-warning.html#:\~:text=EPS%3A%20%240.51%2C%20adjusted%2C%20versus%20%241.26%20expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/24/nvidia-reports-slowing-growth-after-earlier-warning.html#:~:text=EPS%3A%20%240.51%2C%20adjusted%2C%20versus%20%241.26%20expected) Nvidia (NVDA) is down 3.47% premarket.

2,"TLDR; SEAS is not a 50$ stock. Im buying puts and thinking about going short for the first time ever. SeaWorld, ticker $SEAS, is an aquatic theme park that- look, Im sure you know what the fuck sea world is and the shady shit they do. To sum it up real quick, a documentary was released years ago called Blackfish exposing the abuse and mistreatment of the whales and animals in parks like these. Caused some controversy, but ultimately the company bounces back and people sort of forgot about it (not fucking me). Fast forward to 2020. Seaworld stock was now sitting at ATH of around $35 a share and COVID suddenly hits. A legendary WSB user known as u/fuzzyblanket notices and decides to buy $SEAS death puts right before it tanked due to covid. Long story short he got rich as fuck and has moved on from us retards now. Fast forward AGAIN to 2021. SEAS was sitting at around 30$ and in hopes of a quick recovery from this covid shit (vaccine hopes + short squeeze), investors and mainly institutions drove the price up. And Im talking wayyy up. From 30$ a share on February 1st, to all time highs of $50 by the end of March. Keep in mind that SeaWorld has been forced to keep some areas/events closed, and therefore revenue and attendance are down 96% yoy. They have had to add on a significant amount of debt to stay afloat as well, about $225 million, bringing total debt to around 2.2 billion now. Though I believe people may rush into these places after COVID, the damage from losing money for several quarters has been done, and whoever thinks this stock is worth 50$ when everything is not fully open is dreaming. A 70% gain in 2 months is simply unreasonable for a company losing 25 million every month. Our boy Fuzzy bought puts when SEAS was 35, I say buy em when its 50 now. Volume is low but has been increasing very quickly, the stocks up 4% today somehow. I genuinely think this is a shitty company, both financially and ESPECIALLY morally. I say FREE THE FUCKING WHALE and lets put this stock into the ground ."

2,"Nouriel Roubini, an economist who predicted the 2008 financial crash, said he believes there is a ""long and ugly"" recession occurring in both the US and globally at the end of 2022, which could potentially continue through the whole of 2023. In an interview reported by Bloomberg, Roubini said it could cause a sharp correction in the S&amp;P 500 by 30%, ""even in a plain vanilla recession."" However, in his expectation of a ""real hard landing,"" the S&amp;P 500 could decline 40%. The chairman and chief executive officer of Roubini Macro Associates, nicknamed Dr. Doom following his 2008 prediction, warned that anyone expecting a shallow US recession should examine the extensive debt ratios of corporations and governments. Roubini added that as rates increase and debt servicing costs grow, ""many zombie institutions, zombie households, corporates, banks, shadow banks and zombie countries are going to die."" Meanwhile, he believes getting to a 2% inflation rate will be a ""mission impossible"" for the Federal Reserve, and he expects a 75bps rate hike at the current meeting and a 50bps increase in November and December. Roubini believes inflation means the Fed probably has no choice but to continue increasing rates, and when the world is in recession, he does not believe fiscal stimulus will be able to help as governments with too much debt are ""running out of fiscal bullets,"" resulting in stagflation. ""It's not going to be a short and shallow recession, it's going to be severe, long and ugly,"" Bloomberg quoted Roubini as saying. Source: [https://in.investing.com/news/nouriel-roubini-dr-doom-expects-a-severe-long-and-ugly-recession--bloomberg-432SI-3350293](https://in.investing.com/news/nouriel-roubini-dr-doom-expects-a-severe-long-and-ugly-recession--bloomberg-432SI-3350293) 'Dr Doom Nouriel Roubini expects stocks to fall as much as 40% amid a ""long and ugly"" global recession.

2,"Over the past 24 hours, GameStop NFT has made about $166,800 in sales. Since the platform only takes a 2.25 percent cut of NFT sales, this comes out to just $3,753 in revenue. Since GameStops nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace opened in mid-July, daily sales have dropped to less than $4,000. This suggests that interest in the platform has dropped significantly. Data from DappRadar shows that GameStop NFT has made about $166,800 worth of sales in the last 24 hours.

2,"lurker here. popped in here to see if anyone had been posting about the cel token short squeeze i had seen on twitter via #celshortsqueeze and read that wsb was involved. after some searches, not so much. at least not here on reddit. it seems i like investing in projects that get attacked, xrp, lbry, cel, and i keep a good chunk of my stuff in celsius network.i got contacted a couple times on twitter by fudsters trying to scare me out of celsius network. bunch of lies where told, but a couple truths i didn't know about (celsius had been trading assets but saying the yield was from loans)apparently a bunch of exchanges had told celsius network to go down with the ust/luna ship and celsius got out instead to protect it's customers, and now these exchanges are butt hurt and trying to destroy celsius in 3 different ways all while scapegoating celsius as the main reason ust/luna fell when it was already falling when celsius got out.first are intense fud campaigns which include a bunch of lies and a bunch of youtubers proclaiming celsius fully dead already when what they are having is a liquidity problem that forced them to halt withdrawals for the first time in their 4 years running. their assets in custody aren't lost, celsius hasn't lost funds, assets are loaned out, staked, and in general they shouldn't of staked so much e t h into e t h 2.0 so, they have access to the assets just not right away, no company with this type of earning model would because the assets are being put to work and can't handle a sudden bank run for assets.the second way celsius is being attacked is they have a long out that will get about half a billion of people's live savings liquidated if b t c dips below 14k. yesterday these exchanges where trying their best to dip the price so that would happen.the third is there are massive whale shorts on the cel token. trying to crush the cel token to help drive out people from celsius network. yesterday celsians and wsb telegram group decided to take as much cel off the exchanges so ftx can't cover the shorts that are happening. most celsians are hodlers and are just going to keep the cel token, where as the wsb telegram types are taking their cel to 1inch and putting in sell orders so ftx's only cel tokens it can buy are 20, 50, and 100 dollars each. earlier this week cel was .15 cents, it's currently .67 cents. i bought my cel early 2021 for 2.10, it went up to 8 mid 2021.celsius isn't perfect, they put their customers first over back room deals/friendships with other institutions, and probably didn't know just how much they would be between a rock and a hard place. that they would get bullied this hard by institutions that don't care if they destroy peoples lives and are in fact actively trying to hurt people. so.. while celsius fucked up... i rather see the types who are trying to destroy lives to really feel a short squeeze. not financial advice. you can read more about it on twitter via #celshortsqueeze , and aaron bennet on youtube put out the best info I've found about the matter so far. what i am posting here is just a summary, it goes much deeper."

I put in my last 3k of liquidity i had left and bought more shares. The next day everything went total downhill.I sold at around 10$ to use momentum of another stock to regain some of that loss. Later bought back in to BBBY at 11$. In total i invested 18k into this and i am now almost 10k down. I lost hope BBBY will recover near 20$ from this..

1,"I have to say that I didn't understand why BBBY is booming and was reluctant as well. However, it seems it is the play rn. I just wanna mention that in April there was a stock squeezing (can't mention the ticker because it's below 1B cap, but it's delisted now). The short interest was above 100% due to a merger. That stock ran from $2 to $18 and I had long calls but guess what they did? Yup, they made all options close only so no one could buy calls or puts options claiming that not enough shares are available and they sold the options by mistake. My options were around $1 and went to $0.05 in a single day. Nothing happened to the market makers and they killed the gamma squeeze and the ticker is delisted as of a week ago.Even though options are tasty as f$ck, I just wanna say be careful, they will do everything in and outside of the book to kill this rally. Have to say I don't have a position as of right now due to lack of cash (soon I'll get it)."

2,"With the Fed removing ""any remaining doubts about its commitment"" to strongly tackle extremely high inflation, Morgan Stanley's top equity strategist Michael Wilson is increasingly confident in his prediction that U.S. stocks are yet to hit the real bottom. The strategist sees both stocks and bonds taking ""another leg lower"" in response to the growth trajectory in earnings and the economy, as well as the strong dollar. ""While hard to predict such ""events,"" the conditions are in place for one, which would help accelerate the end to this bear market,"" Wilson told clients in a note. Wilson also sees an ""untenable situation for risk assets"" for risk assets given the soaring U.S. dollar, which could prompt ""a financial or economic crisis, or both."" Morgan Stanley strategists have a $118 price target on the dollar index (DXY), which suggests more upside. ""On a year over year basis, the DXY is now up 21% and still rising. Based on our analysis that every 1% change in the DXY has around a -0.5% impact on S&amp;P 500 earnings, 4Q S&amp;P 500 earnings will face an approximate 10% headwind to growth all else equal,"" the strategist added. Morgan Stanley's top strategist also sees accelerating negative earnings revision in the next 1-2 months, a development that should facilitate the next log lower in stocks. ""We remain highly convicted in our view that the bear market in stocks will not be over until the S&amp;P 500 reaches the range of our Base and Bear case tactical targets i.e.,3000-3400, later this fall,"" Wilson concluded.

Then we have the 1960's and the hippie movement... nuff said. 30 years later we're in the 1990's with the blunt explosion, SnoopDogg, Cypress Hill, and Dr.Dre's The Chronic smashing into mainstream music and culture.

In thinking about the ways that GME may or may not play out next week, a thought struck me and I'd like some input that may dictate how long we need to hold for. Say they started covering their $15 shorts at $100, then re-bought shorts at $150, then $200, etc, then covered their $150 shorts and re-bought shorts at $300. This would probably mean that they would have a lot less interest to pay to hold the shorts, and may have a longer lifeline than any single investory who likes $GME would want to hold on to their shares for. Can you offer any insight?"

0,I have many questions about this. Is it really a good idea to invest now? According to the article they are going to lend money as I understood.
2,"If you ask 90% of people what drives stock prices, most of them will say things like earnings, PE ratios, forward guidance. The reality is that none of these things matter today. In today's market, factors such as earnings, PE ratios, and forward guidance play almost NO ROLE in the price action of a company's stock. The number one driver of stock prices is the price action taking place in the debt market. In fact, the stock market as a whole derives its value from action in the debt market meaning that the stock market is a derivative of the debt market itself. To drive this point home, let's look at what central banks have been doing since the 2008 financial meltdown. They've been artificially suppressing interest rates, and it's worked really well in inflating another huge stock and real estate bubble. Low interest rates that are artificially suppressed by central banks create an environment of risk, as cash is forced into riskier assets such as stocks. This also drives up the price of real estate. In addition, this suppression of rates has robbed savers of trillions of dollars in wealth by keeping savings rates below the actual rate of inflation. The global inflation and freefalling economy today are a direct result of central banks artificially suppressing rates for years following the last major meltdown. Central banks are responsible for the global financial and economic systems, both of which are inextricably connected. Moreover, central banks working in concert are deliberately driving the world right into a financial/economic crisis of truly epic proportions. Central banks have been deliberately and meticulously working to hyperinflate a global debt bubble. Cracks in this bubble are now beginning to show, particularly in the form of rapidly rising global bond yields. This in turn is putting pressure on global stock prices. It is only a matter of time before an extreme sell-off in the debt market occurs. But a stock market crash- even one of this size- is the smallest issue. The real problem is a worldwide financial system shutdown, which means ALL TRANSACTIONS STOP. There would be no cash available from banks, credit cards and ATM cards would be unusable, no lending, everything would come to a halt. Do not be mistaken, central banks are working intentionally towards this inescapable end of the current system(s) only to usher in a new system that they have much more control over where, when and how much of their product Central Bank Currencies ie: ( USD, CAD, AXY, JXY, BXY) you can spend.

They'll end up showing less bleeding in earnings from this, and have good PR to fall back on about being financially responsible.

2,"Green day in the market will most likely equal a red day for GME &amp; AMC. If youre in it for the cause then hold! If youre in it for profit, get ready to sell or lose some money today. If you cannot afford to lose money, dont keep buying more. This could lead to a big recession and thats not something our economy needs at the moment. ONLY RISK, what you can afford to lose. Dont let peoples decision in here, manipulate yours. Especially if youre a new investor. Theres a bull and bear market. Surely bears will rip you new investors apart. Majority of the people in here are trying to make a profit. NEW INVESTORS. Dont let FOMO take over. Prices for both AMC &amp; GME are very high and at their peak. We dont know for sure if there is another short squeeze. Short interest is below 100% which isnt good. This could plummet tomorrow, nobody knows. New investors, Im just trying to look out for you guys. Stocks dont just go up, they go down. Best of luck."

However, the uninformed could construe this terrible behavioral outburst as a reflection of $BBBY, which we do not deserve since Gustavo at his worst was a criminal awaiting a billion dollar lawsuit. If this stock goes down because of him, we should all go spit on his grave. What do you think? Will $BBBY rise or fall?"

I can't think of any other way to stop losing. 10% inflation loss seems preferable to getting rug pulled every other month.

2,Didnt realize I was being downvoted lol. The point thats interesting about this is that AMC is Diluting at the literal absolute low. Its one thing to do it like AA did at the freaking peak of the price. But its another do do it today. We will likely find out soon if AMC is truly a tool to hedge the meme stock basket if the price randomly runs before the sales are complete. GameStop on the other hand is down cash but up inventory to nearly equal parts. Im not a finance major and Im sure people will pull out some BS financial terms but thats just how I see it. The only reason in my opinion that GameStop is down since August is explained by XRT hitting the threshold list last week. When they cant use the stock they use the ETFs. But thats just a can kick. More to come but dilution is not on GameStops agenda especially at the freaking lows.

There is $17.24 discount on Xlnx for various reasons. Once the deal closed, XLNX will gap up.

1,Okay lets start off with explaining what this company does. Xeris Pharma is a biotech company that makes reverse diabetes medicine. Essentially when your blood sugar gets to low. U can take their drug and you wont die. They are also working on some other technology which you can read up on their website. Xeris at its current rate will be cash flow positive by 2022. They have hundreds of millions in cash while the market cap is only 300 million. On top of that the short interest is about 35% and the short borrow rate(the interest you pay for borrowing a stock to short) is nearly 40%. and their is almost now shares to short left. (We bull has disabled shorting on xers) The strong fundamentals combined with a potential short squeeze could make the company worth 3-4 billion going off the past short squeezes that have happened in other similar companies. That could mean a 10x or even possibly a 20x play if we can drive this up to a price where a short covering recursion loop occurs.

Heavily shorted by WS. The company does have a great content library and needs a streaming distribution deal to reverse this trajectory. It would take 14 days to cover the short float.

1,"Most of the stocks I buy are nonsense. &amp;#x200B; But today, I picked up 2 shares of NVDA as part of a plan to move my portfolio more into long term investments. With the announcement that the US is no longer letting Nvidia sell AI chips to China, it's become clear that the world's largest military now sees Nvidia as a security asset. And we all know how the US likes to pick winners. &amp;#x200B; But more broadly, I expect an AI goldrush at some point in the next few decades. Maybe sooner given how clearly afraid the US are of the technology's real and upcoming future. And who makes the most during a gold rush? The people selling the pick-axes. So yeah. It's a fair bit lower than it probably should be right now, for a LOT of reasons, a fair number of them quite legitimate. But I do believe that nvidia will recover, and I'm fairly certain that in the medium to long term future this will be a cash cow."

Thoughts, Opinions, Predictions, etc all welcome - This is not an advise post, just a pick your brain and let me see what the community thinks before I personally choose one of them to dump into. Thoughts between them below, given the recent 4090 BS, EVGA partnership loss, AMDs supposed amazing GPUs coming soon, Intel's upcoming chips, etc. I think AMD is going to come out strong toward the end of this year into next year - Between the BS nvidia has done with the 40 series and the (hopefully) amazing price to performance that amd is reportedly bringing, plus the uplift the new ryzen chips are getting compared to intel.... yeah i feel like AMD is in a position to really increase it's market share by massive amounts on both fronts. I don't see a recovery plan for NVIDIA right now given the inflation and TSMC price increases ontop of the cost to produce the 40 series AND the backlog of 30 series cards lol.... As for Intel, eh idk i just feel like ryzen is going to top the charts this time around and intel will struggle to keep up - In regards to price to performance specifically, but that is left to be seen."

2,"This Sub was created in 2012. We havent had a bear market since 2008. Before that was 2000, before that was 1987, before that the 70s, which did take a while to come back from The bears come out to play about once every 15 years.. 7-8% of the time and go back to hibernate usually around a year or so The question is, will you keep buying the dip eating red crayons, buying worthless memes making newer monthly lows, no fundamentals and no cash to come out of a liquidity crunch or do you have a strategy to take you to Tendie Town. I shake my head and cringe when I read Regards buying the dip and memes or both. I have been trading since 1994. It is time to pivot and wait for greener pastures for the Bulls to come out and play.

1,"Its been 21 months since the Sneeze of GME, and in that time the company has completely transformed itself. From a brick and mortar retailer to an ecommerce company with a renewed focus on collectibles and digital asset ownership. The company has raised over a Billion dollars in cash through a stock sale and also boasts a billion dollars in inventory. They retired all debt early and have leased a 700,000 square foot distribution warehouse with plans on leasing more warehouse space in the future. They have an entire section dedicated to PC gaming including peripherals and individual components, with prices comparable or even below that of amazon. They have shut down low performing stores while simultaneously cutting its c-suite bloat, using that money instead as a compensation package for its front line retail workers. They have a board of directors who actually *listen* to their shareholders, and a shareholder base who actively communicates their needs to the board. Their current negative EPS is a direct result of an increased investment in transforming the company; see RCs Chewy interview for his philosophy on growing a business. They have not only created a marketplace for buying and selling digital assets, but have also created their own wallet and been partnering with pioneers in the space such as Loopring, IMX, and most recently FTX. Their *beta* marketplace did more volume in its first 3 days than coinbases marketplace has done in its lifetime. The e t h merge has just happened, reducing the energy cost of transactions by 99.8%. Investors in GME have Directly Registered 23% of the entire company as of GMEs Q3 10-Q. Public short interest currently stands at ~51 million shares or 25% of the float, still extraordinarily high. If Gamestop were in real financial trouble they could issue another stock sale, only 300m of the 1bn authorized shares are currently in the market. Im sure there are a ton of other points Im missing, but extrapolating from their current cash burn GME wont be going bankrupt for at least 5 years , and even then they can issue more shares or take on debt to finance the business."

0,"I am having difficulty understanding the basics of a long vs short position in trading foreign currencies. I know you should take a long position if you expect the currency to rise, and a short position if you expect the currency to fall. The problem is calculating the profit. For example, the British pound appreciated relative to US currency from January 19 to March 16. On January 19 the exchange rate was 1.3644 GBP/USD. On March 16, the exchange rate was 1.3901 GBP/USD. The Pound obviously got stronger. I have to invest $100,000 USD into GBP. This means I could buy 73,292.29 pounds on January 19 and sell for 71,937.27 on March 16. Does this mean I have a profit of 1,355.02 pounds? When I convert this back to USD, the profit should be $974.76 (1,355.02 pounds divided by the current exchange rate of 1.3901). Also, if I took a short position it would be a loss of $974.76? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"

0,"Rereading through the 8-K I came upon this, ""Licensee acknowledges that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GameStop Corp., a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. To the extent any change of control occurs that results in Licensee no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded U.S. company, Licensee must, upon written request of Immutable, identify itself and its beneficial owners to Immutable and must not hide its identity"" In the 8-K, the ""Licensee"" is GME Entertainment, LLC, not GameStop. So GameStop created and owns a company called GME Entertainment, LLC, and *this* company is in partnership with Immutable X. Now look at this line: ""To the extent any change of control occurs that results in Licensee no longer being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded U.S. company..."" What it is saying is that as of right now, GameStop outright owns GME Entertainment, LLC, and if any change in ownership were to occur, GME Entertainment *must* identify itself and and who owns it, upon the request of Immutable. Why does this matter? There is a secret company, that the general public is not aware of, that is being built for the purposes of providing a marketplace for Web3 gaming assets (NFTs). This company is being funded by GameStop, is not shortable, but yet has the full support of GameStop shareholders. GameStop shareholders acted as Venture Capitalist when GameStop sold $1+ Billion into the open market. Shareholders bought into a startup company. Startups are inherently risky, but their payoff is generally much greater than the capital invested. To be a Venture Capitalist you much have money and generally, be an accredited investor, non of which the average person is. What most of GameStop shareholders might not explicitly be aware of, is that shareholders were given a once in a life time opportunity to be a Venture Capitalist and invest in a new era of gaming, Web3 gaming. It's a risky investment, no doubt, but the potential is there and the right people and partnerships are in/coming into place, in my opinion. It's just a matter of patience for the startup to reach its full potential. Also though, GameStop shareholders *could* (this is speculation) also more directly benefit if GameStop were to spin this company off and issues shares of GME Entertainment to GameStop shareholders. The result of that spin off is up for further speculation, but you get the idea. Right now the NFT marketplace is in Beta, and according to the filing, "" Platform Launch means the bona fide public release of the GameStop web-based NFT trading platform in the U.S. and certain mutually agreed upon non-US regions, which integrates Immutable Xs layer two technology. **Platform Launch shall take place within twelve (12) months**, plus any Extension Periods, of the Effective Date"" Effective Date being 28 January 2022. The ""real"" ""official"" bona fide NFT marketplace, the way in which it was built for (gaming NFTs) should be release within 12 months of January 2022, so about 4 more months. After launch, GME Entertainment has 24 months to hit $1.5 billion in sales in order to achieve milestone 4. Milestone 5 is $3 billion in sales within 24 months from the effective date. From the effective date, GME Entertainment has 2 years to meet all the milestones. Let's focus on the milestone sales of 1.5 billion dollars and turn that into a company valuation. From various websites, the market multiplier for software tech companies ranges from 5x-40x. Using the lower band to keep discussions more reasonable, 1.5 billion dollars in revenue would value the company at 7.5 billion dollars; 3 billion dollars in sales (milestone 5) is 15 billion dollars. So 7.5 - 15 billion dollars baseline. What the market decides is anyone's guess, but there will probably be a lot of speculation in the open market once all of this hits mainstream. If using GameStop shares outstanding, it would put GME Entertainment stock price at $50/share. So add $50 to whatever the current stock price of GameStop for simplicity. Now of course there are assumptions and speculations here, but considering that GME Entertainment is a startup, assumptions and speculations are required."

2,"We are loosing this fight by fellow retards recommending stocks that are never going to squeeze. Amc isnt going to squeeze, they just did a stock offering. Nokia isnt going to squeeze, too many shares with too big of a valuation. The only two stocks that will realistically squeeze are GME and SPCE. Spce just had a downgrade, has a lower float than gme and is highly shorted. GME is questionable at this point due to the manipulation. Just look at the charts for all the squeeze stocks, they are practically the same at this point, meaning shorts are winning. Tldr, focus on gme and spce PositionsSPCE 2/5 60cGME shares"
2,So obviously Nike got rekt on earnings today. Down to almost $85 currently. What do you think will happen in pre-market and on open tomorrow?

2,"Listen you bunch of regards! No one gives 3 $h!ts about CPI! NO ONE! Well, consumers do... But that is the same as no one to the Fed. CPI includes energy and food, rising energy and food is often transitory and difficult to control with monetary policy. So they look at Core which excludes energy and food. It is ALL they care about really. They have said they want it at 2 in the past, but a couple of years ago they said 3 would be ""OK"", and now they say 2.5, but they would take 4. It's at 6.3 and it rose .4 from last month. No one is losing their mind about CPI going up .1, no one! Well... consumers, but that is the same as no one to Wall Street. I actually thought with the supply pressure index peaking last December and core starting to come down since March, along with the Fed tightening, they would pause soon, being already near neutral. While I knew they would hit us for .75 in September anyway, I thought they might only hit us for .50 in November, and then hold a while from there, ""if"" core was easing down this month and next. But that is out the window now unless core dramatically comes down in October. Buckle up, it may get real ugly. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/ho94q8x94nn91.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7039f033c88f3168bc176c4c696ab5760964e90"

1,"I am making this post to let everyone know my thoughts regarding the way that GME, AMC, and BBBY are positioned for tomorrow headed into Quad witching day. - Review of the Day Compared to the broad market, all three stocks did very well. Individually, on the [daily chart](https://imgur.com/a/cRiMExm), GME is remaining immediately below it's volume shelf, AMC is actually just above it's volume shelf, and BBBY is struggling the most with multiple immediate deep volume shelves above it. What this means is that AMC is positioned the best (on the daily time frame), GME is positioned very well (especially considering the impressive manner with which it closed the day; see the volume candle at the bottom of the screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/0jCI)),and BBBY is not far behind (considering it's rally into the close, as well; see the volume candle at the bottom of the screenshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/Xle2Xoa)). Outside of this, as of yesterday, the skew for all of these tickers was indicating that they would likely face bearish sentiment (more positive value actually indicates more bearish sentiment). However, as of today, they are all [skewed](https://imgur.com/a/pWIgmS0)in favor of bullish sentiment. For those of you scratching your heads saying ""what does skew mean?"" It is a measure of the total implied volatility to both the upside and to the downside. So, if the total implied volatility tells you that a stock is likely to move wildly in a general direction, the skew tells you which direction that wild swing is likely to move toward. - What does all of this mean!? Ultimately, I suspect that the broad market is likely to remain flat or even perhaps ralley tomorrow given that it is Quad witching day, the [SPY](https://imgur.com/a/devHb64) rallied into the close, and that the price action naturally gravitates toward the point of control (POC; red line flowing from the strongest volume shelf). I suspect that this will serve to propel our beloved Meme Stocks toward Valhalla... All we have to do is break away from our own volume shelves, and then, they are gone! Let me know if anyone has any questions. I'm happy to help. I am learning alongside you and so, I appreciate you making me think critically. I welcome negative criticism. :) Tl;Dr - Tomorrow's OPEX looks great for our Meme Stocks. The broad market is likely to remain flat or ralley tomorrow, thereby helping our movement."

1,Hundreds of thousands of people over the internet saw the gigantic rise of GME stock in 2020 and wished they had gotten in. This historical precedent means that they will be more likely to bug BBBY out of FOMO. This means that the potential gains on BBBY far surpasses those of GME since now a lot more people have their eyes on Meme Stocks and are more willing to invest.

And you cannot enter multiple search terms to filter by. So if you're looking for a king size sheet set made from cotton or bamboo, with 300-500 thread count, good luck.

0,"I don't care what BBBY does to remain solvent and close to profitability, if they need to close 75% of their stores and get their employees down to 100 people, then do it. What's more important is the live grenade that is the stock price. Our system has become so financialized, companies and executives using stock valuations as collateral to finance their lives, fundamentals no longer matter. We saw what happened with HKTD. Cramer wasn't whining about their profitability, was he? BBBY is about whether or not we can keep pushing the share price up and bleed the shorts out just like Tesla did. Brick by brick. I don't think Cohen is a dummy. GME/BBBY really aren't about the products/services, they're just about keeping the company and share price alive and as high as possible. We saw what happened with those zombie stocks that were all but dead, trading at .00001. All of a sudden, a 10,000% gain one day. Cohen and his big money backers found the short meme basket, started turning those companies around and came up with a plan to squeeze the shorts' nuts. At least, that's what I'd do. I think DRS is the smart decision. Options are too fickle and can be slammed out of the money, handing millions over to the MMs. We need to do something consistent. Your thoughts?"

1,"While meme stocks are often associated with risky investments, there are a few with strong fundamentals that investors might want to buy to cash in on the craze. Nokia (NOK): Nokia has transformed dramatically, re-emerging as a major player in the telecom industry. When looking for the best meme stocks to buy, it is important to shield yourself against volatility. The best way to do so is through investing in meme stocks with strong fundamentals. For example, you want to look for stocks with a history of growing earnings, a strong balance sheet and a proven business model. Additionally, consider buying stocks that trade at low valuations to protect yourself against this inherent volatility. For many investors, meme stocks and solid fundamentals do not go hand in hand. Companies such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) are best known for being volatile, and investors often feel they cant be relied on to provide stability. While there is no guarantee that any particular meme stock will be successful, investors should carefully research any stock before buying it. Not only do these three companies have strong business models, but they are also operating in high-growth industries. This fundamental strength gives them a distinct advantage over other companies that do not have such a safety net. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) was once the undisputed king of the mobile phone market. However, its dominance began to unravel in 2007 with the introduction of the iPhone. It was slow to embrace touch screens and failed to capitalize on the popularity of app stores. As a result, its once-loyal customer base began to desert Nokia in droves. The company desperately attempted to regain market share by adopting Microsofts (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system, but it was too late. By 2013, Nokias phones were no longer selling in significant numbers, and the company was forced to sell its handset business to Microsoft. However, Nokia has been focusing on 5G for the last five years, and it looks to be in a prime position to continue succeeding in this new area. The company has been investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) for 5G technology, and its products have been well-received by customers. Nokia is also one of the few companies with a complete end-to-end 5G solution, which gives it a significant advantage over its competitors. Nokia has stitched together seven consecutive earning beats, demonstrating the companys superior fundamentals. It is also a well-rounded company with a diversified product portfolio and a strong presence in emerging and developed markets. Furthermore, Nokia has a strong balance sheet with plenty of dry powder to invest in growth initiatives. In sum, Nokia is a high-quality company with a bright future, which is why Nokia is among the best meme stocks to buy."

1,"My fellow autists, Once again the world has sought to divide us. Yesterday it was with silver and short ladder attacks. Last week, with brokerages. Before that, politics, race, Android and Apple, football and football, smooth brain and smoother brain. This narrative has dragged on for as long as I can remember. The hedge fund managers and corporate backers and media pundits who've pushed us towards failure for decades are the same who seek our failure today. To them, we're no different than the commodities and securities they so freely and fragrantly manipulate. At our expense they use our diamond hands, gorilla strength, and full tilt retardation against us, and the truth is that until now we've drooled idly by and let it happen. We let them overshort us to the brink of moral bankruptcy, economic collapse, and cultural disaster, while they sat back and stuffed their pockets with our tendies. Until $GME. We, in all of our smooth brained glory, came together in the name of a hopeless cause because we believed we had the power to change it for the better. We set aside our differences and agreed that despite them, we found something worth fighting for. Today we stood shoulder to shoulder with the great apes of old. We fervently beat our chests with diamond hands and shouted ""HOLD"" as we stared down our oppressors. Some paper hands fled in the face of this tyranny, but we HELD! In glorious revolution we lit our forges and fired that paper into endless diamonds. Now, on the frontline of yet another bloody battlefield, we find ourselves strapped onto the backs of rockets. Ready to launch ourselves into the heavens if only to add more stars to the night sky for those below us. We do not fear death, for what's $323 worth when priced against the soul of our people? Take in the enemies terror. Look them in the eyes as we take to the stars my friends, for they'll speak of us generations from now. Apes bring hope. Diamond hands no drive good, rockets only go up. We go too? Make no mistake, we are here fighting for so much more than $GME, but it is absolutely $GME that we're fighting for. Believe in us. Believe in yourself. Believe in a better world for all smooth brains where the bulls**t the elites pull on us and call ""protection"" is brought to the dirt and burned off in the glow of our afterburners. With hands like diamonds we sail into the tides of eternity,Monkeys amongst the stars. WE LIKE THE STOCK."

1,"Imo, I think bbby will do better when they get a new CFO why? Because knowing that Arnal participated on a pump &amp; dump and didnt care much about the company, what would the future had looked like for bbby with a CFO like that? Holders have to trust the company."
1,$BIG Big Lots is a viable business thats profitable with a very high dividend. You cant say that about any of the favorites of the degenerate crowd. $BIG is a much better gamma squeeze candidate with affordable cheap options.

1,"There is a lot of talk about ""being good people"" when we moon from GME but when I post a question to try and help people in my life who are unaware of GME, my post gets removed from r/GME which is sad to see, I am just looking for answers. There are people in my life that I cannot convince to invest in GME. Does that mean I want them to suffer? Absolutely not. What the fuck is wrong with people. The only people I want to suffer are the hedgefunds, not normal people. Although my portfolio is 100% GME across 3 brokers, I can't convince my family members. I can't blame them, as they're from an older generation and do not really understand what is going on. Despite this, I do not want to see people close to me suffer as a result of hedgies completely fucking over the market to cover their positions. They're mainly invested in things like Tesla, NVidia, SPY and other boomer-type stocks. I don't know much other than GME and told them maybe water ($AWK) would be a good idea. They think gold/silver. Any advice would be great. As for me, I am hodling to the moon."

2,"With skyrocketing markets along with low interest rates, it's clear that we're in an unsustainable territory. At some point, money injections and stimulus will narrow down, and interest rates might even start increasing. **But does it even matter?** Why working so hard for shooting something to the moon when it's clear it's only a market manipulation and many will stay to turn off the light? There are so many overvalued stocks today, isn't it more logical to ** PUT them to death**? Besides, apes should feel much more comfortable breaking stuff rather building stuff. So many hedge funds are leveraged to death, and most of the holdings are LONGs and not shorts. Margin calls when PUTTING stonks it much more lethal, and apes might even be tagged as 'smart' accidently."

Rumble Video will be trading on the Nasdaq as a freshly merged symbol **RUM** on Monday. The valuation is 2.5 Billion atm which is ridiculous. It's been stuck in the SPAC phase so it's always had a floor of $10 and couldn't go lower. For most of the time after the initial business announcement a year ago it's been pretty much right at $10 flat. It could never fall below $10 cause SPAC. During the run-up people bid it up 40% so I went super short. However, when Monday comes it can finally fall below $10 which it will. Honestly at $5 (1 Billion valuation) is still too high but that's when I will cover my positions. I honestly think most people in this forget that this stock can actually fall below $10 when it starts trading on the Nasdaq as RUM on Monday.

1,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is set to give its latest quarterly earnings report [today after close](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/ulta). Analysts estimate that Ulta Beauty will report an earnings per share (EPS) of $5.00. Ulta Beauty bulls will hope to hear the company to announce they've not only beaten that estimate, but also to provide positive guidance, or forecasted growth, for the next quarter. We should note that it is sometimes not an earnings beat or miss that most affects the price of a stock, but the guidance (or forecast). Shares of Ulta Beauty were trading at $401.31 as of August 23. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 5.12%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are likely bullish going into this earnings release. Last quarter the company beat EPS by $1.84, which was followed by a 12.47% increase in the share price the next day. They posted 54% earnings growth, with sales rising 21%. Analysts expect earnings-per-share growth of 9% for the quarter, and 13% growth for the full year. This ones an easy with with calls. That's why I'm picking up 8/26 440c @ 4.10/share."

I just find it cool to see how stock trading can help eliminate the burden of college loans / debt. College is a wonderful experience to learn and develop, but not when people are left with decades of debt. The system needs to change but I'm glad students are investing to break this trend. Peace, and good luck trading!!!"
1,"So we all heard about Citidal and the 600m loan that they took to deal with the 'volatility' situation they are in it.For me we got them real hard, They use that money to x2 and x4 thire positions, probbly by doing some more shady things such as ghost shares and trading in the black pull.We won this fight to many time, it cost them bilions over and over again..Now, when they are deeply invested in BBBy, this is just a matter of time and a test for our will.Is just that simple, We keep doing what we did (that works) Buy&amp;HoldFOR THE NOOBIES:Buy only with money that you can efford to Hold!Do not go all in!I saw here some posts with over 50k likes.If every like here has around 300s avg* (some has 2000 and some 50), Only with that we could cuse a real damage (squeez) to somone who took a loan to win us and short with no logic. BBBY has a float of 70m~ shares, Thats Nothing!!All we need to do, is to have some trust in the process and the comunity and some paitions for the bampy ride. See you (again) in no time on the Moon!"
0,I know its a stupid question but want some copium. Is the short interest and hype around BBBY equivalent to how GME was when it had its run? I need a pop to $300 to make me rich.
0,"Many of us here use different trading strategies, some win and some lose.How much of the losses are because of us rather than the strategy in use? Is our strategies failing us or do we fail the strategy? How will things look like is an emotionless robot took over our trading?"

1,"For what it's worth... This morning I called up Fidelity because I wanted to make sure my extended hours trading was enabled on my account...took 90 minutes on hold to get through. Apparently, they are slammed over at Fidelity, I asked the gal on the phone what's it been like today...she said because of all this stuff with Robinhood, they're looking at +700% daily volume for transferring accounts, which is quite amazing. Happy hunting! WE LIKE THE STOCK! STICK IT TO THE MAN!"

2,I just put a deposit down on a brand new 22 civic. What are the odds the economy collapses before it gets delivered?
0,"Wny are there three posts at the top of hot saying $GME is having a 3:1 stock split when it isn't having a stock split at all? Seriously. $GME is *not* doing a stock split. It is issuing a \*STOCK DIVIDEND\*. There is a difference! **Stock Split:** All shares in all accounts holding $GME are cut in four. Where you once had 1 you now have 4. **Stock Dividend:** The Gamestop board ***mints 3 new shares for each 1 actually existing share then sends them to the DTCC for them to be distributed to shareholders.*** You're all big boys and girls, you can figure out why this distinction is important. (Remember that Tesla's 5:1 ""Stock Split"" in 2020 was actually a Stock Dividend). End of rant."
0,"TA is not astrology, I will debate this. From trading, I have learned that technical analysis is 100% real and it is all about probability, just because RSI is oversold does not mean a stock will go up now it just means there is a higher probability of more buyers stepping in. With experience, you can combine multiple indicators and price action trends to gain a better idea of the short-term future of the price. And for long-term investments, FA tells you what to buy and TA tells you when to buy..."
2,But what bulls dont understand is DXY and global recession will negatively effect said earnings
0,"Etsy also seemed to hover around the $10 mark for a while before eventually going 15x+. However, it took years to steadily increase. Is this the potential path for Wish or does it never break out? Maybe a steep increase is only influenced by retail investment (unlike Etsy)? Also I dont hear people talk much about the class action lawsuit(s) with Wish. Is this because it does not matter, or is that sort of thing common enough that it is not a factor?"

0,"Someone told me about the idea of option spreads, and I'm honestly just being lazy about figuring out if they're a good or bad idea. I think they're probably a bad idea and people may not realize how much because they don't consider the cost of the premiums, but I figured you guys could tell me if I was wrong. Most importantly, it seems like it's not only betting on individual stocks, but betting on individual stocks at certain prices against a generally more well-informed party. Am I correct in my thought process here? Are they even worse, or are they much better in some way I'm not considering? What are the chances of actually making money on them? (That last question is surprisingly hard to Google and get a quick, solid answer.)"
1,"An air force buddy of mine told me about SFOR which is now trading as ZRFY valued currently at like 1.6 cents Literally now is the time to buy into that since its like #169 on the popularity list haha. Everyone is watching GME (the only true meme anyway) and so distracted by things like that. Just sayin, might be worth a shot to totally side swipe the market again."

1,All in with my trading account about 1000 shares on tqqq and another 400 using money from the savings account and maybe another 400 if it goes under 25 or at 26 depending what the market says tomorrow I believe market should be up on Tuesday next week. The wife has not been willing to invest anymore in the whole year but today she approved and thats a buy signal.

2,Maybe why ryan chohan sold his shares was because of the hedge funds who own the majority of the float. And they kicked him out off bbby since its gonna squeeze and the dtcc committed security fraud they told them kick him off because he is basically an insider. And can cuck them even more since they are basically GONNA STEAL FROM TEACHERS AND EVERY god damn PENSION FUND. 2008 again???!Im high as fuk and Im not sure if high or Im right.

An Update for those:eToro - is looking good but I dont think they have AMCTrading212 - Yes as well but be cautious as they froze earlier UPDATE2: Freetrade is allowing orders again.I will say I feel it is a useless gesture as they made the announcement to stop at the start of the trading day and then made the announcement we could buy again at the end.

These sensors can prevent oil spills/leaks as well as prevent flooding. A company like this has real value, which is why hedge funds are shorting this stock. Look at the damage we caused sending GME to the moon and F****** over those damn hedgies. I call all of you idiots to action once more to see the value in DPLS and make wallstreet lose billions once more"

1,A big selloff happened last week because everyone was fearful of core cpi and expecting a bigger than thought rate hike from the fed but it wont happen since jpow will stick to his plan of a soft landing. Last time in june when 50 bps were promised but the cpi data was so bad the fed decided to do a 75 rate hike they warned wall street before and a big selloff began before the decision was announced. It was done because they didnt want to shock the market following their decision. Nothing like that happened in the last days and the whole market is behaving like the whole economy will collapse. Dont be scared of all this and buy calls

1,$AMC went to 77$ on 20% SI.500m shares float. $BBBY has 75m shares float and atleast 50-60% SI *Reported* yes some over 100% even. This would put $BBBY around 500$ in squeeze mode compared to $AMC.

I also made myself a reminder to look at buying calls on CPER (US copper index fund - tracks copper futures). I can't remember why I was wanting to make a bullish play on copper... may have been a past conversation with the local crackhead where he kept talking about looking for abandoned places that still had copper wiring, but I'm really not sure. Anyways do yall think Oct $22 calls sound like a good strike? I might go for Jan 2023 expiration instead... And is there any benefit in trying to get physical delivery of copper?"

1,"Alright gang, time to pump this extremely shorted stock. You don't need a 20% downpayment to get out of mom's basement. Long Call Options are cheaper. And a stock is the same price than a Wendy's Biggie Meal. Financials: Current Market Cap is $700M. RDFN reported $590M in Cash alone at the end of 2021. Not including inventory owned and any other assets. Also most of their liabilities are in Convertible Senior Notes issued for 2025 and 2027. Totaling $1.2B. Effective interest rate on these? both at .42% and .9% issued in 2020 and 2021 respectively. RDFN King of Free Money Tendies. Sooner or later the crows come home to roost and these investors will want their money in the form of cash or shares. To combat this potential share dilution RDFN themselves engaged in 2027 capped calls valued at $93/share. They paid $62M for these calls. Either they are degenerate yolo bagholders right now or they truly believe they will be at $90/share at 2027. If my choices are pay for a house in cash by 2027, or remain homeless until then, i'd choose the former. Guidance/Outlook: Real Estate transactions slowing down is a risk with rising interest rates, but in actuality RDFN's US market share by value is only 1.17% of the total real estate market. Definitely a lot more room to grow. With the new generation of buyers being more well versed in the digital world, the need for realtors is becoming obsolete. Not to mention RDFN's rental services is booming. Revenue was $0 in 2020, but $121M in 2021. That's 6.3% of their total revenue. Their Gross Profit for rentals was $100M while Brokerage services was $300M. Redfin is sneakily turning into a rental company than just a mere brokerage service. They did not shutter their home buying services like Zillow did. And their profit shows that they have a better understanding of the real estate market than their ibuying competitors like the O's that can't be named, and Z. Downsides: One thing I would like RDFN to get rid of is in their Mortgage servicing arm. No point in trying to be a bank. Especially with interest rates fluctuating. It's losing them money each year. TLDR: If currently living in basement, Skip the $5 Biggie Meal, Buy $RDFN instead. Move out sometime 2025-2027. Not financial advice."
2,"With low trading volumes on this S&amp;P rise and the threat of numerous Black Swan events on the horizon, I'm thinking it's pretty much bottomed."
0,"So.. If a company uplists to NASDAQ, and also offers lets say $10M in warrants and then gets the boot, both the ticker and warrants. What happens to those warrants? Is the company liable for that $10M because they cant be exercised to regular shares? Or is it just a complete loss for warrant holders or something else?"

1,"So reason I believe $WISH is going too $62 is because I feel there is a secret message I have discovered. It all comes from the hit song Airplanes by B.O.B. Specifically from the lyrics I could really use a $wish right now$Wish right now, $wish right nowCan we pretend that airplanesIn the night sky are like shooting stars?The wish right now wasnt a song at all. It was the ticker marker. And the shooting star is the stock shooting up in value. So now youre asking why $62? Simple. The song released in April 13th 2010 and the songs duration is 3:01. But the duration is actually telling us month and days to add from release date. Meaning the surprise valuation is coming exactly on April + 3 = July 14th. Just 3 weeks away. As for the price valuation, it is because it debuted at 62 on the Canadian 100. But yall may say why Canada? Because maple syrup is delicious. This isnt a meme stock yall. This is a conspiracy unfolded. Yall have 3 weeks to buy as much as possible."

1,"Like some of you, I have a firm belief that despite the current macro economic climate, the emerging psychedelic medicine sector will continue to move upwards in tandem with regulatory policy. Bottom line,long term, I'm bullish. We're on the tail end of the initial clinical trial push driven by both private and public entities (London Imperial College, UCLA, MAPS, et al.) where the efficacy of medicines such as psilocybin and MDMA has been empirically demonstrated. This will help consolidate the push for patient prescriptions across the spectrum. Additionally, this is a global phenomenon with a total addressable market that includes North America and most countries in South America and Europe. To capture as much value as possible, I'm currently thinking of running an automated investment strategy where every month I invest in the three biggest psychedelic stocks with the best performance over the previous month. Thoughts on this? https://preview.redd.it/v7fwuegbthp91.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fe529c773b65c47c87c054a92ba25992de0e10c"

1,God to many memes in here its time to get some real DD back in this sub ###What is LAZR? LAZR is a company that builds sensors for self driving cars it is located in Florida ###What is so great about LAZR? A few things come to mind 1. It's founder is the youngest self made billionaire in history he started with around a 100k and made his first billion by the age of 26 2. The company has three separate self made billionaires investing in it 3. The company already has contracts with China and Japan and 30 of the largest car manufacturing businesses in the world ###So why has the stock tanked so hard since 2020???? That's a stupid question we are in a bear market very few things are going to come out of this unscathed ###Why did a analyst lower its price target??? Also a stupid question it's obvious because most analysis are overpaid people with fancy degrees that like to pretend they understand the market when in reality no one truly knows what will happen we are all just guessing. ###So why should I listen to you??? You shouldn't do your own DD but I'm serious when I say that by 2030 its going to make people super wealthy! It's like buying TSLA when it first came out Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk

1,"Alright listen up you retarded apes. After this weeks move its time we revisit BABA. First my personal thoughts on why the move: everybody and their mother knows BABA is fundamentally undervalued but have been staying on the sidelines like scared little bitches because of some vague China fears. Same thoughts are running on the institutional side and majority of hedge funds being the sheep they are, theyre all afraid to act first and pull the trigger. With the public news of ARKK and a couple other funds buying up BABA and other Chinese stocks this has finally signaled to the other hedgies that its okay to invest in China and now theyre all trying to pile back in at the same time. Institutional FOMOs gonna drives this beast back up. So imo the recent moves been sentiment driven but we havent even triggered any of the fundamental catalysts yet thatll further pump this bitch to the moon. Heres some to name a few, all likely due later this year or early next: 1. ANT IPO. Lot of ancillary news coming out around this such as Ant being approved to operate a consumer finance company by regulators, working together with state owned companies to create a credit scoring company. This shows Ant and the regulators are willing and able to work together. And making headwinds fast.2. Listing of 9988 on the HKSE Stock Connect Southbound program. This means Chinese investors would finally be allowed to trade the stock and you bet these rich fuckers wont have the same hesitations American apes will about YOLOing into their home grown crown jewel company. This gets revisited if HKSE gets 55% share of outstanding shares traded vs the ADR. MSCI the giant index fund has already migrated their shares over from BABA to 9988 and other funds might follow suit to protect their shares in light of fears over US delisting Chinese stocks.3. Earnings release - important number to look out for imo is BABAs operating profits on their cloud computing arm Alicloud. Theyve invested a ton of money into cloud computing and gotten huge market share. So far theyve always reported an operating loss on this but the numbers are improving every quarter and theyre on the cusp of finally being in the green now. This year might be when they finally turn a profit. For those who know, this was when AMZN skyrocketed and the same will happen to BABA when they finally get there. Cloud computing is a huge cash cow with big profits low costs thatll be a huge boon on their operating margins which has been one of the only fundamental weak points of the company so far.4. 13F filings for Q2. We all know the stock popped when Charlie Munger disclosed a position. We may see another if we see him adding to the position or if any of his other value investing buddies like Buffett getting in on it too. For those who are worried they missed the move its not too late still. My guess is therell probably be a pullback next week so you apes have a window to get in before its too late. I know Ill be adding to my position and my tits are already thoroughly jacked on this one to begin with. Lastly, just look at BABAs net profit last year: $21bn. What was AMZNs net profit that year? $21bn. Except AMZNs market cap is $1.7 trillion and BABAs is $620bn. In other words AMZN is valued 2.8x higher than BABA for generating the exact same profits. Plenty of money to still be made here. Tl;dr buy some BABA if you want to make money you fking retards."

1,"Please forgive my ignorance as I have been bullish on this stock for way too long. With the housing market coming out of the largest BOOMS (at least that I can recall) which caused house prices to skyrocket , there has still remained a downward trend on rocket mortgage. I understand that interest rates were low, but the houses were costing double which shouldve made every deal rocket mortgage signed worth double. Now to the refinance side of things! Right now, no one in their right mind would want to refinance, especially if they are locked in at a low interest rate. This also can benefit rocket mortgage as they will keep customers locked in at higher interest rates due to the fed hikes. Any basic amortization calculator can show that locked in mortgages will pay better than letting someone refinance in a couple years to cut their rate in half. Not to mention what is happening on the auto side of things, and all the big events $RKT sponsors. I believe that this stock is extremely undervalued for the conditions we currently live in, but I am curious what everyone else thinks?!?"
0,"CNBCs Jim Cramer on Thursday said that inflation could soon decline, leaning on charts analysis from legendary technician Larry Williams. The charts, as interpreted by Larry Williams, suggest that inflation could soon cool down substantially soon if historys any guide, he said. Cramer's comments come after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points and reiterated its hawkish stance against inflation. To explain Williams analysis, the Mad Money host first examined a chart of the current Federal Reserve sticky price consumer price index (in black) compared to the burst of inflation in the late seventies and early eighties (in red). https://preview.redd.it/1bh8g604ulp91.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7305f198b4097c9fb87203843034544081d982c9 Williams notes that the current trajectory of sticky price inflation has closely hugged this historical pattern, Cramer said. He added that when situated in the pattern of inflation in the late seventies and early eighties, current inflation is roughly in the 1980 point of the trajectory which is around when inflation peaked then. Today, unlike back then, the Fed knows exactly how to beat inflation, and Jay Powell has shown that hes willing to bring the pain. That means it should peak sooner, Cramer said.

And then trade without having to risk my own capital. What are your opinions on these firms?

1,"Target is currently trading at around $240 per share. Firstly, I believe it's undervalued based on its price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.58, when compared to its competitors (COSTCO has a P/E of 36.589, Walmart has a P/E of 31.829). A look at the Enterprise value to EBIDTA ratio (EV/EBIDTA) tells a similar story. It should be noted, though, that TGT has a higher debt-to-equity of 1.02 ratio than some Costco and Walmart, although it isn't high enough to raise concerns about its risk. Based on fundamentals alone, it seems like a solid pick. This is supported by the fact that it absolutely crushed earnings back in April, beating EPS by a whopping 104.36% and revenue by a reasonable 14.24%. It saw a nice pump after earnings was disclosed, but it has still steadily increased in price since then (6.1% in the last month). I think that it will continue to grow now that summer is here and there is increased shopping, not to mention reopening and lifting of COVID restrictions. Positions: 50 shares at $225 and two 240c expiring Jan 2022 What do you think about $TGT?"

2,"Hi all. I spoke in the pre-market about how I believe that Monday is going to be horrendous for the whole UK, but I wanted to take the time to write a whole ass essay about why, because I believe there's some nuance that couldn't be shared over a quick voice chat. TL:DR - the UK is poised to fall into an '08 tier recession, is already sliding there, and as much as I hate to admit it, now is a good time to be a rainbow bear. So, first off, I stand with my assertion that Monday is going to be a bloodbath. Why? Because that's the first trading day after the energy price cap changes. On Saturday, the price cap on energy will be raised significantly, meaning that nearly the whole country is going to face an increase in energy bills that will, for many, simply be untenable, or at the very least, impossible to pay without massive cutbacks to spending. I'm talking anywhere up to about 200 a month extra per month, with some households set to get even higher, depending on supplier and usage. There's no way around it, this is going to be utterly brutal. But if that were the only thing happening right now, then we might be able to get away with it. After all, other European countries are dealing with crazy energy prices, but here's why I believe the UK isn't just fucked, but UNIQUELY fucked. For a live play-by-play of the chancellor's meeting with banks and the BOE, see this insightful video: [Kwasi Kwarteng.mp4](https://youtu.be/MFX0MggWdNc) So, apart from the price of keeping homes warm as winter approaches reaching a staggering new high, with January poised to possibly make it even worse, there's also some other juicy factors. Factors such as, say, the Bank Of England jacking interest all the way up to 6 percent by next year: [actually a real article and not a shitpost](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/26/pound-sterling-uk-interest-rates-bank-of-england) . Oh baby, you know you love some big, fat interest. That big, fat interest, mind you, is already making folks' house moves fall through, and is pretty much set to make any borrowing extra hard for the people who need loans and mortgages the most. Who, incidentally, are the ones about to be buttfucked-no-lube-spiky-drilldo-style by the cataclysmic energy price rises. Are we starting to see the problem here? Then there's the inflation. No, not the kinky kind, more the kind that makes barrels a leading fashion choice. That inflation is still at near enough %10, driven mostly by food [real source 2, electric boogaloo](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/august2022) and other living expenses. In layman's terms, the UK has experienced an increase of about five or so years of inflation, all at once, to coincide with the first wave of truly bonkers energy price rises. And finally, what of wages? [live feed from downing street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhckuhUxcgA) but no, seriously, wages aren't going up to help people pay for this shit. SO what's the government doing about all this? Surely they have a plan? Didn't I hear something about the BOE eating debt just to keep the economy stable? Yes, you did. Because UK pension funds just got margin called for enough money to invade Iraq with. Yeah, you bet I got a source for that: [Margin calls - not just for WSB idiots any more](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7954682/uk-pensions-hit-with-ps100m-margin-calls-as-gilts-and-sterling-slide) . But that's not all, folks, no, because, you see, the government are going to be giving everyone a 400 payment to help with energy bills and are going to be cutting all the taxes, everywhere. Except that payment isn't going to go very far, and not even the UK banks or the actual motherfucking IMF think the chancellor's recent economic plans is a good idea. [real source 4: this time it's personal.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/09/28/ftse-100-markets-live-news-pound-bonds-bank-england/) If the people in the glass buttplug think your economic policy is shit, it's probably shit. Oh, and the pound saw its lowest value since decimalisation, so, effectively, the lowest it's ever been. Here's one last article, from goddamn Bloomberg to hammer it home: [Real Source 5: the source awakens.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-26/emerging-market-currency-crisis-tag-is-alarming-for-britain) So, in summary: the UK is going to fall into a recession hard and fast, and October is going to be one of the worst months since 'rona hit. Plays: Puts on anything in the FTSE100, calls on barrels, dollar/pound shenanigans."

Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However Im thinking about a few things: Presidential cycles: (formatted weird due to some rules) For like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year. Teslas trend: Absolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, Im doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD. NOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY: It really isnt. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elons commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, its just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I dont expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but Id rather bet on the company with the biggest head start. Elon Musk: You gotta love him. Hes helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And hes an absolute savage. Im also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as hes already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors. TLDR: Why the fuck havent we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you dont like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk.

You fools want to say diamond this, ape nation this, etc et, but when the true APE test comes you side with the corrupt hedge funds and their puppet main stream media. SAVA shorted 35% and small float!!! That and the fact they have the ONLY drug to show effectiveness in ALZ, the GOLDEN GRAIL OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT ! Its almost like discovering insulin or penicillin!"

2,"I hate the cult and I made a nice double bagger on BBBY puts, because I watched the exact same GME cult nonsense infest BBBY. You morons are endless entertainment, so we decided to make a subreddit as a hall of fame to your collective stupidity. Anyway, try not to work us slaves too hard after the global economy collapses and video game pawn shop shareholders are the new ruling elite. Totally not a cult."
